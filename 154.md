# Malicious User Could Block Other Users From Completing Regular Withdrawals.

## Summary
In the `completeWithdraw` function, there is no explicit check to prevent a malicious user from repeatedly initiating withdrawals and never completing them. If a malicious user repeatedly calls `initiateWithdraw` and never `completeWithdraw`, it could potentially block the entire vault from progressing to the next epoch, effectively preventing all other users from completing their withdrawals.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function completeWithdraw() external whenNotPaused {
    VaultLib.Withdrawal storage withdrawal = withdrawals[msg.sender];

    // Checks if there is an initiated withdrawal request
    if (withdrawal.shares == 0) {
        revert WithdrawNotInitiated();
    }

    // At least one epoch must have passed since the start of the withdrawal
    if (withdrawal.epoch == getEpoch().current) {
        revert WithdrawTooEarly();
    }

    _completeWithdraw();
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a limit on the maximum number of uncompleted withdrawals a user can have at any given time. This limit could be enforced in the `initiateWithdraw` function, preventing users from initiating new withdrawals if they have already reached the maximum allowed uncompleted withdrawals.

Another possible mitigation could be to introduce a timeout mechanism for uncompleted withdrawals. If a user fails to complete a withdrawal within a certain number of epochs, the initiated withdrawal could be automatically canceled, freeing up the vault to progress to the next epoch.
