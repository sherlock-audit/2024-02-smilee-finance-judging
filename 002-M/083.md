# No updation of _state.liquidity.pendingWithdrawals may lead to abnormalities while completing withdrawals of share

## Summary
while initiating withdrawal inside contract `valut.sol` using function `_initiateWithdraw()` there in no implementation for updating `_state.liquidity.pendingWithdrawals` , since this function is used only to initiateWithdraw , and the shares to be withdrawn are added to  `withdrawal.shares` , which is a type of pending Withdrawal share and will be later be used to liquidate the share using `completeWithdrawal()` function .

## Vulnerability Detail
since the `_state.liquidity.pendingWithdrawals` is not updated inside `initateWithdraw()` function , now when user intend to complete withdraw using `completeWithdraw()` function which later calll `_completeWIthdraw()` which looks like :
```solidity 

    function _completeWithdraw() internal {
        VaultLib.Withdrawal storage withdrawal = withdrawals[msg.sender];

        uint256 pricePerShare = epochPricePerShare[withdrawal.epoch];
        uint256 amountToWithdraw = VaultLib.sharesToAsset(withdrawal.shares, pricePerShare, _shareDecimals);

        // NOTE: the user transferred the required shares to the vault when (s)he initiated the withdraw
        _state.withdrawals.heldShares -= withdrawal.shares;
        _state.liquidity.pendingWithdrawals -= amountToWithdraw;

        uint256 sharesToWithdraw = withdrawal.shares;
        withdrawal.shares = 0;
        _burn(address(this), sharesToWithdraw);
        IERC20(baseToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amountToWithdraw);

        emit Withdraw(amountToWithdraw);
    }

```
here pendingWithdrawls is being deducted which is not updated earlier
```solidity
 _state.liquidity.pendingWithdrawals -= amountToWithdraw;

```
This can lead to Potential DOS , due to underflow error .

## Impact
HIGH

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _initiateWithdraw(uint256 shares, bool isMax) internal {
        // We take advantage of this flow in order to also transfer any unredeemed share to the user.
        _redeem(0, true);
        // NOTE: since we made a 'redeem all', from now on all the user's shares are owned by him.
        uint256 userShares = balanceOf(msg.sender);

        if (isMax) {
            shares = userShares;
        }

        if (shares == 0) {
            revert AmountZero();
        }

        if (shares > userShares) {
            revert ExceedsAvailable();
        }

        Epoch memory epoch = getEpoch();
        VaultLib.Withdrawal storage withdrawal = withdrawals[msg.sender];

        // If there is a pre-ordered withdrawal in the past, the user must first complete it.
        if (withdrawal.epoch < epoch.current && withdrawal.shares > 0) {
            revert ExistingIncompleteWithdraw();
        }

        // Update user withdrawal receipt:
        // NOTE: the withdrawal.shares value is zeroed when the user complete a withdraw.
        // NOTE: if there is a pre-ordered withdrawal in the current epoch, it is increased; otherwise it starts from zero.
        withdrawal.shares = withdrawal.shares + shares;
        withdrawal.epoch = epoch.current;

        // -----------------------------
        // A withdrawal pre-order free space for further deposits, hence we must
        // update the vault capacity.
        //
        // The deposit receipt must also be updated in order to correctly update
        // the vault total deposits, shall the user initiate other withdrawal
        // pre-orders in the same epoch (as it is used for such computation).
        //
        // Steps:
        //   - estimate the increased capacity by computing the following proportion:
        //       withdrawed_shares : user_shares = x : user_deposits
        //   - use the found number for decreasing the current number of deposits.
        //   - update the user's deposit receipt [cumulativeAmount] value.
        VaultLib.DepositReceipt storage depositReceipt = depositReceipts[msg.sender];
        // NOTE: the user deposits to consider are only the ones for which a share has been minted.
        uint256 userDeposits = depositReceipt.cumulativeAmount;
        if (depositReceipt.epoch == epoch.current) {
            userDeposits -= depositReceipt.amount;
        }

        uint256 withdrawDepositEquivalent = (userDeposits * shares) / userShares;

        _state.liquidity.totalDeposit -= withdrawDepositEquivalent;
        depositReceipt.cumulativeAmount -= withdrawDepositEquivalent;
        // -----------------------------

        _state.withdrawals.newHeldShares += shares;

        _transfer(msg.sender, address(this), shares);

        emit InitiateWithdraw(shares);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`_state.liquidity.pendingWithdrawals` should be updated inside `initiateWithdraw()` function
