# hedgeMargin equal to zero leads to using a larger amount than usual while buying side tokens

## Summary
In the Protocol Details they said that admins are TRUSTED, but from code prespective and security we have to be sure about that, So here no checks on the **`hedgeMargin`** paramter and admins can set it to be qual to `Zero`.


## Vulnerability Details
In function `setHedgeMargin` that can be called by admin to set the hedgeMargin that will directly affect in this function `_buySideTokens` 

Itâ€™s check if 

```solidity
    if (hedgeMargin > 1000) {
        revert OutOfAllowedRange();
```
and no checks if hedgeMargin is not equal zero to revert that will allow easily to set to be equal zero.


In function `_buySideTokens` 

If the available base tokens `availableBaseTokens` are less than the `requiredInput` for the swap, the contract attempts to adjust by approving the maximum available base tokens for the swap `amountToApprove = availableBaseTokens`. This adjustment is straightforward and does not directly involve `hedgeMargin`.

However, the critical part comes next. If the available base tokens are also less than the `minRequiredInput`, the function adjusts the amount of side tokens to be bought by reducing it according to the `hedgeMargin`. This reduction is meant to handle extreme scenarios where swap slippages could significantly affect the transaction, allowing the contract to still perform a swap but for a reduced amount of side tokens. Specifically, the reduction is calculated as:

 `amount -= (amount * _hedgeMargin) / 10000;`

By setting `hedgeMargin` to zero, the function would not adjust the target amount of side tokens downwards to accommodate the limited availability of base tokens. The calculation would attempt to subtract zero from the `amount`, leaving the `amount` unchanged.

## Impact
having a `hedgeMargin` of zero makes the function `_buySideTokens` more exposed to unexpected price swings during the token purchase. This could lead to using a larger amount than usual,  It means that the initial `amount` used for buying side tokens will not be adjusted downward, making the contract more vulnerable to bad market conditions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
we need to add in function setHedgeMargin a check to check if it's qual to zero and revert.
