# Precision loss when calculating shares to mint

## Summary
Due to division before multiplication and how solidity rounds down any remainders, calculation of shares to mint for epochs will be lower than expected, leading to users receiving less shares than expected when they choose to redeem.

## Vulnerability Detail
`_beforeRollEpoch` is a hook that is called before rolling the epoch. It calculates the sharePrice for the epoch based on the locked liquidity and outstanding shares. `uint256 sharePrice = VaultLib.pricePerShare(lockedLiquidity, outstandingShares, _shareDecimals);`

Here is the calculation performed:
```javascript
    function pricePerShare(
        uint256 assetAmount,
        uint256 shareAmount,
        uint8 tokenDecimals
    ) external pure returns (uint256 price) {
        uint256 shareUnit = 10 ** tokenDecimals;
        if (shareAmount == 0) {
            // 1:1 ratio
            return shareUnit;
        }
        assetAmount = assetAmount * shareUnit; // Fix decimals in the following computation
        return assetAmount / shareAmount;
    }
```
The `sharePrice` is then used to calculate the `sharesToMint`:
`uint256 sharesToMint = VaultLib.assetToShares(_state.liquidity.pendingDeposits, sharePrice, _shareDecimals);`

Here is the calculation:
```javascript
    function assetToShares(uint256 assetAmount, uint256 sharePrice, uint8 tokenDecimals) public pure returns (uint256) {
        // If sharePrice goes to zero, the asset cannot minted, this means the assetAmount is to rescue
        if (sharePrice == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (assetAmount == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        return (assetAmount * 10 ** tokenDecimals) / sharePrice;
    }
```

As you can see, due to the math operations and division before multiplication, there will be precision loss when calculating the `sharesToMint`. This will mint less shares than what is expected, impacting the shares users will be able to redeem.

`_mint(address(this), sharesToMint);`


## Impact
Users will receive less shares than expected

## Recommendation
When calculating the `sharesToMint` specifically, consider performing the calculation in one joint operation where division is performed last.
