# Inability to redeem shares due to the whenNotPaused modifier

## Summary
Due to the `whenNotPaused` modifier, users will not be able to call `Vault::redeem` and redeem their shares if the protocol is paused.

## Vulnerability Detail
As stated in the summary, users will not be able to redeem any shares if the contract is paused. In addition, I am confident that this was not the intention of the protocol, since each function in the `Vault.sol` contract that has the `whenNotPaused` modifier, also has the `isNotDead` modifier. However, the `redeem` function does not have the `isNotDead` modifier. This means that `redeem` can still be used when the state of the vault is "dead", but not when it is paused. Users should be able to redeem their owed shares when it is paused as well.

## Impact
Users owed shares stuck in vault when contract is paused.

## Code Snippet
`Vault::redeem` [#L406-412](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L406-L412)
```javascript
    /**
        @notice Redeems shares held by the vault for the calling wallet
        @param shares is the number of shares to redeem
     */
    function redeem(uint256 shares) external whenNotPaused {
        if (shares == 0) {
            revert AmountZero();
        }
        // NOTE: if the epoch has not been initialized, it reverts with ExceedsAvailable.
        _redeem(shares, false);
    }
 ```

## Recommendation
Consider removing the `whenNotPaused` modifier from `redeem`
