# Inadequate Input Validation Leading to Incorrect Token Swap Balance Calculations: in providers/SwapAdapterRouter.sol

## Summary
The **_slippedValueOut** function in the provided Solidity code lacks proper validation checks for the **tokenIn** and **tokenOut** parameters, potentially allowing an attacker to pass arbitrary token addresses. This could lead to manipulation of the **amountOut** value calculated by **_valueOut** and the **getSlippage** function, resulting in incorrect minimum and maximum output amounts (**amountOutMin** and **amountOutMax**).
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of this vulnerability in the provided code is that the function **_slippedValueOut** does not validate the input parameters **amountIn** properly before performing calculations.

Specifically, on **line 274**, the function calculates the **amountOut** based on the input parameters **tokenIn**, **tokenOut**, and **amountIn**. However, there is no validation or check on the **amountIn** parameter to ensure that it is a valid and non-negative value. This lack of input validation can lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect calculations if a negative or invalid **amountIn** value is provided to the function.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the calculation of **amountOutMin** and **amountOutMax** on lines 275 and 276. The function **_slippedValueOut** is supposed to calculate the minimum and maximum amount of tokens that can be received after a swap, taking into account slippage. However, the calculation is not properly validating the input values, which can lead to incorrect token swap balance calculations.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the input values of **amountIn** to trick the contract into miscalculating the minimum and maximum amounts of tokens that can be received. By providing a large **amountIn** value, the attacker can potentially receive more tokens than expected due to the incorrect calculations of **amountOutMin** and **amountOutMax**.

Proof of Concept (PoC) code:
```solidity
// This is a simplified version of the vulnerable function for demonstration purposes
function _slippedValueOut(
    address tokenIn,
    address tokenOut,
    uint256 amountIn
) private view returns (uint256 amountOutMin, uint256 amountOutMax) {
    uint256 amountOut = _valueOut(tokenIn, tokenOut, amountIn);
    // Incorrect calculation without proper input validation
    amountOutMin = (amountOut * (1e18 - getSlippage(tokenIn, tokenOut))) / 1e18;
    amountOutMax = (amountOut * (1e18 + getSlippage(tokenIn, tokenOut))) / 1e18;
}
// Attacker manipulates the input amountIn to exploit the vulnerability
function exploit() public {
    // Provide a large amountIn value to manipulate the calculations
    uint256 manipulatedAmountIn = 1000000; // Large amount
    (uint256 manipulatedAmountOutMin, uint256 manipulatedAmountOutMax) = _slippedValueOut(tokenIn, tokenOut, manipulatedAmountIn);
    
    // Perform the swap with manipulated values
    // The attacker can potentially receive more tokens than expected due to incorrect calculations
}
```
By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can potentially manipulate the token swap calculations to receive more tokens than expected, leading to financial losses for the smart contract users.

## Impact
 If exploited, this vulnerability may enable the direct theft of user funds or cause protocol insolvency by enabling transactions with manipulated slippage values, thereby disrupting the integrity of balance calculations within the smart contract. The absence of safeguards against unauthorized token pair inputs elevates the risk of financial loss and undermines the trustworthiness of the contract's swap mechanism.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that the input values used in the calculation are properly validated to prevent any unexpected behavior. One way to do this is by adding input validation checks to ensure that the values used in the calculation are within a reasonable range.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to include input validation checks:

```solidity
269       function _slippedValueOut(
270           address tokenIn,
271           address tokenOut,
272           uint256 amountIn
273       ) private view returns (uint256 amountOutMin, uint256 amountOutMax) {
274           uint256 amountOut = _valueOut(tokenIn, tokenOut, amountIn);
275           uint256 slippage = getSlippage(tokenIn, tokenOut);
276           
277           require(slippage <= 1e18, "Slippage value exceeds maximum");
278           
279           amountOutMin = (amountOut * (1e18 - slippage)) / 1e18;
280           amountOutMax = (amountOut * (1e18 + slippage)) / 1e18;
281       }
```
