# PositionManager will revert all `mint` attempts if actual premium charged is greater than premium calculated from oracle price.

## Summary

`PositionManager.mint` calculates expected premium from `dvp.premium`, then approves this amount of base token to `dvp` address, before calling `dvp.mint`. The problem is that `dvp.mint` can charge a larger premium if delta hedge swap price is worse than oracle price. In such case, `dvp.mint` will revert when trying to transfer premium from `PositionManager` due to approval which is less than charged premium.

As a result, `PositionManager` will revert all attempts to mint position when underlying dex price is worse than oracle price.

## Vulnerability Detail

`PositionManager.mint` first calculates premium (from oracle price) and then transfers such amount of base token from the user to `PositionManager` and approves this amount to `dvp` before calling `dvp.mint`:
```solidity
    uint256 obtainedPremium;
    uint256 fee;
    (obtainedPremium, fee) = dvp.premium(params.strike, params.notionalUp, params.notionalDown);

    // Transfer premium:
    // NOTE: The PositionManager is just a middleman between the user and the DVP
    IERC20 baseToken = IERC20(dvp.baseToken());
    baseToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), obtainedPremium);
    // Premium already include fee
    baseToken.safeApprove(params.dvpAddr, obtainedPremium);

    premium = dvp.mint(
        address(this),
        params.strike,
        params.notionalUp,
        params.notionalDown,
        params.expectedPremium,
        params.maxSlippage,
        params.nftAccessTokenId
    );
```

Notice, that `dvp.mint` is passed `expectedPremium` (user-provided value), but transfers and approves `obtainedPremium` (calculated value). When actual premium is higher than `obtainedPremium`, `dvp` won't have enough allowance from the `PositionManager` (and `PositionManager` won't have these additional funds either) and will revert when trying to transfer funds from `PositionManager`.

```solidity
        uint256 swapPrice = _deltaHedgePosition(strike, amount, true);
        uint256 premiumOrac = _getMarketValue(strike, amount, true, IPriceOracle(_getPriceOracle()).getPrice(sideToken, baseToken));
        uint256 premiumSwap = _getMarketValue(strike, amount, true, swapPrice);
        premium_ = premiumSwap > premiumOrac ? premiumSwap : premiumOrac;
...
        // Get base premium from sender:
        IERC20Metadata(baseToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, vault, premium_ + vaultFee);
        feeManager.trackVaultFee(address(vault), vaultFee);
```

## Impact

In certain circumstances (underlying dex price worse than oracle price) users will be unable to open any new positions via `PositionManager` due to reverted transactions, breaking important protocol functionality and potentially losing user funds / profit due to failure to open position.

## Code Snippet

`PositionManager.mint` transfer in and approves calculated `obtainedPremium` value, which can be less than actual premium charged:

## Recommendation

Consider transferring in and approving to `dvp` user-provided expectedPremium (or if it's 0, calculated premium + maxSlippage percentage).
