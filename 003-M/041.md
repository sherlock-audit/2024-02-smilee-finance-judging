# PositionManager will revert all `mint` attempts when trying to `safeApprove` `dvp` address to spend tokens if it hasn't spent all tokens approved previously

## Summary

`PositionManager.mint` uses `safeApprove` to approve base token to be spent by dvp address:
```solidity
    baseToken.safeApprove(params.dvpAddr, obtainedPremium);
```

However, if dvp doesn't spend all allowance when charging premium, there will be a leftover remaining and all subsequent `mint` attempts will revert, because `safeApprove` enforces that either previous or new allowance = 0, but it will try to change non-0 allowance to another non-0 allowance, which will revert.

As a result, `PositionManager` will becomes useless, because it will be impossible to use it to mint new positions (buy options), so core protocol function will stop working.

## Vulnerability Detail

Openzeppelin `safeApprove` function is used to prevent approval front-runs by enforcing first approving to 0, then to a new amount. It's implemented as following:
```solidity
    function safeApprove(
        IERC20 token,
        address spender,
        uint256 value
    ) internal {
        // safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
        // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
        // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
        require(
            (value == 0) || (token.allowance(address(this), spender) == 0),
            "SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance"
        );
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, value));
    }
```

`PositionManager.mint` uses this function to approve dvp address to mint option position. Since the actual premium charged can differ from pre-calculated amount, not all allowance might be used. In such case all further `PositionManager.mint` calls will revert due to `safeApprove`.

## Impact

In certain circumstances users will permanently be unable to open any new positions via `PositionManager` due to reverted transactions, breaking important protocol functionality and potentially losing user funds / profit due to failure to open position.

## Code Snippet

`PositionManager.mint` transfers uses `safeApprove` which might revert if current approval is not 0.

## Recommendation

Consider approving dvp to 0 after calling dvp.mint to remove any unnecessary approval remaining.
