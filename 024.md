# Potential DOS due to blocking of `safeApprove`

## Summary
`safeApprove` Method requires the zero allowance before approving a new value .

## Vulnerability Detail
At contract `DVT.sol`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/DVP.sol#L173
The use of safeApprove method can lead to potential blocking to next safeApprove call, if the feeManager fails to utilise full provided allowance before the next selfApprove call , becuase selfApprove method requires zero Allowance before approving new value

## Impact
High

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    
        IERC20Metadata(baseToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), fee - vaultFee);   
        IERC20Metadata(baseToken).safeApprove(address(feeManager), fee - vaultFee);    
       
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend to always reset allowance to zero by calling `safeApprove` with 0 amount.
