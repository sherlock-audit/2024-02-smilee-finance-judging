# The refunding feature in the PositionManager contract will always revert due to insufficient approval

## Summary
See detail

## Vulnerability Detail
The following logic is used to refund users when extra tokens were sent to the PositionManager contract:
```solidity
if (obtainedPremium > premium) {
    baseToken.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, obtainedPremium - premium);
} 
```
This logic was added as a fix to a bug found in the previous audit, but this logic has a severe issue. It uses `safeTransferFrom` to send the funds from itself. This requires the contract to first approve itself to increase it's allowance. However there is no logic in the contract to provide approval to itself. Therefore, this refunding feature will revert EVERY TIME.

## Impact
Whenever funds are supposed to be refunded from the PositionManager, it will revert and the user will not be able to mint their DVP position, severely disrupting protocol functionality.

## Tool used
Foundry testing, no manual review

## Recommendation
Use `safeTransfer()` instead of `safeTransferFrom()` to refund.
```diff
if (obtainedPremium > premium) {
-    baseToken.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, obtainedPremium - premium);
+    baseToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, obtainedPremium - premium);
} 
```
