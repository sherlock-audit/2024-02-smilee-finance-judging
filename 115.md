# Missing necessary checks on the quality of price feed data from Chainlink oracle

## Summary
The protocol (`IG.sol`) is querying price data from the Chainlink oracle in several functions, and using the price for downstream calculations; however, the contract is not checking any necessary timestamps for that price feed before using it.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the functions where Chainlink oracle price feed is used, there aren't any checks on the `latestTimestamp`, or the `updatedAt` value from the `latestRoundData()`, or even the heartbeat time stamp to ensure the price info is not stale.

## Impact
It introduces the risk of using stale prices for the calculation of premium, delta hedge, strike price...etc., leading to incorrect results being used by the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement checks on the price feed timestamp as well as the heartbeat heartbeat timestamp, and invert the transaction if the price feed appears stale per the team's criterion of threshold.
