# Potential for Sandwich Attack Due to Lack of User-Defined Slippage Parameters in Exchange Swap Function: in Vault.sol

## Summary
The **_buySideTokens** function in the provided code snippet contains a vulnerability where user funds can become temporarily frozen due to insufficient liquidity or unacceptable slippage. The function attempts to swap **baseToken** for **sideToken** and reduces the amount of **sideToken** to be bought if **availableBaseTokens** is less than **minRequiredInput**. However, there is no check to ensure that the reduced amount can be successfully swapped, nor is there a mechanism to recover funds if the swap fails.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the "Potential Liquidity Shortfall and Fund Freezing in Token Swap Function" vulnerability in the provided code is that the function **_buySideTokens** does not handle the scenario where the available base tokens are not enough to cover the required input amount for the token swap.

In lines **761** and **762**, the code calculates the required input amount and the minimum required input amount for the token swap. Then, in lines **768** to **775**, it checks if the available base tokens are less than the required input amount. If this condition is met, it reduces the amount to approve to the available base tokens and adjusts the amount of side tokens to swap accordingly.

However, in this scenario, if the available base tokens are not enough to cover even the minimum required input amount (**line 772**), the code reduces the amount of side tokens to swap without reverting or handling the situation properly. This can lead to a situation where the token swap cannot be completed due to insufficient liquidity, potentially causing a liquidity shortfall and freezing of funds.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could perform the following steps:

1. Deposit a large amount of base tokens into the contract.
2. Call the **_buySideTokens** function with a significant amount of side tokens to be swapped.
3. Manipulate the available base tokens in such a way that the condition on line **768** is triggered, causing the code to reduce the amount of side tokens to be swapped by a certain percentage.
4. By manipulating the available base tokens and the amount of side tokens to be swapped, the attacker can potentially freeze the funds in the contract by causing the swap to fail due to insufficient liquidity.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code:**
```solidity
// Assume the contract has a function to set the available base tokens
function setAvailableBaseTokens(uint256 amount) public {
    availableBaseTokens = amount;
}

// Call the _buySideTokens function with a large amount of side tokens
function exploit() public {
    uint256 amount = 1000; // Large amount of side tokens
    _buySideTokens(amount);
}
```
By manipulating the **availableBaseTokens** and the amount of side tokens to be swapped, an attacker can potentially freeze the funds in the contract by exploiting the vulnerability in the token swap function.
## Impact
This could result in a scenario where the swap does not execute as intended, and the user's funds are left in a state where they cannot be retrieved, leading to a potential temporary freezing of funds without a clear path to resolution within the contract's logic.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, one possible solution is to ensure that the contract always has enough liquidity to cover the required input amount for the swap. This can be achieved by checking the available liquidity before initiating the swap and reverting the transaction if there is not enough liquidity available.

Here is an example of a patch code to address the vulnerability:
```solidity
function _buySideTokens(uint256 amount) internal returns (uint256 baseTokens) {
    if (amount == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    address exchangeAddress = _addressProvider.exchangeAdapter();
    if (exchangeAddress == address(0)) {
        revert AddressZero();
    }
    IExchange exchange = IExchange(exchangeAddress);

    uint256 requiredInput = exchange.getInputAmountMax(baseToken, sideToken, amount);
    uint256 availableBaseTokens = _notionalBaseTokens();

    require(availableBaseTokens >= requiredInput, "Insufficient liquidity for token swap");

    uint256 amountToApprove = requiredInput;
    IERC20(baseToken).safeApprove(exchangeAddress, amountToApprove);
    baseTokens = exchange.swapOut(baseToken, sideToken, amount, amountToApprove);

    return baseTokens;
}
```
In this patch code, we added a **require** statement to check if the available base tokens are greater than or equal to the required input amount for the swap. If the condition is not met, the transaction will revert, preventing a potential liquidity shortfall and fund freezing issue.
