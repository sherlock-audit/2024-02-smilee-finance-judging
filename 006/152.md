# Insufficient Slippage Handling for Swaps

## Summary
In the `_buySideTokens` function, there are no checks or validations to ensure that the actual amount of side tokens received after the swap matches the expected amount (`amount`). If the actual slippage during the swap is higher than expected, the vault may end up receiving fewer side tokens than intended, potentially leading to losses or imbalances in the portfolio.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L751

```solidity
    uint256 requiredInput = exchange.getInputAmountMax(baseToken, sideToken, amount);
    uint256 minRequiredInput = exchange.getInputAmount(baseToken, sideToken, amount);
}
```

While `getInputAmountMax` returns the maximum amount of base tokens required to buy the specified amount of side tokens, accounting for potential slippage or price impact, the code does not seem to perform any checks or validations on the actual slippage that occurred during the swap.

The code proceeds to approve the `amountToApprove` which can be either `requiredInput` or the available base tokens, whichever is smaller and executes the swap:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L777

```solidity
IERC20(baseToken).safeApprove(exchangeAddress, amountToApprove);
baseTokens = exchange.swapOut(baseToken, sideToken, amount, amountToApprove);
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L797

```solidity
baseTokens = exchange.swapIn(sideToken, baseToken, amount);

```

## Impact
If the actual slippage during a trade or swap is higher than expected, the vault may receive fewer tokens than intended, potentially leading to losses or imbalances in the portfolio. The vault's accounting and state updates may also become inaccurate, as the actual token balances may differ from the expected balances.
