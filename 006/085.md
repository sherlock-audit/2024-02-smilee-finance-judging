# Vault lacks slippage protection when selling side tokens

## Summary
`Vault::_sellSideTokens` lacks slippage protection, allowing front-run/sandwich attacks on the transaction. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_sellSideTokens` function swaps the provided amount of side tokens in exchange for base tokens. It is mainly used to adjust the balances of the vault. It is also used in `emergencyRebalance` in extreme cases where the owner calls this function to sell all side tokens to maximize the amount that can be recovered. 

The problem is that this function does not have any slippage protection to ensure that there is a minimum amount received for swapping the side token for the base token. This can lead to the transaction being front-run/sandwich attacked, where fewer base tokens will be received for the amount of side tokens swapped.

I believe this is high because the balances of the vault (`_sellSideTokens`  is called) before each epoch roll. User shares can be impacted heavily.

## Impact
Side token swaps will be sandwiched causing a loss of funds for users

## Code Snippet
`Vault::_sellSideTokens` [#L797-814](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L797-L814)
```javascript
    /**
        @notice Swap the provided amount of side tokens in exchange for base tokens.
        @param amount The amount of side tokens to sell.
        @return baseTokens The amount of exchanged base tokens.
     */
    function _sellSideTokens(uint256 amount) internal returns (uint256 baseTokens) {
        if (amount == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        (, uint256 sideTokens) = _tokenBalances();
        if (amount > sideTokens) {
            revert InsufficientLiquidity(bytes4(keccak256("_sellSideTokens()")));
        }

        address exchangeAddress = _addressProvider.exchangeAdapter();
        if (exchangeAddress == address(0)) {
            revert AddressZero();
        }
        IExchange exchange = IExchange(exchangeAddress);

        IERC20(sideToken).safeApprove(exchangeAddress, amount);
        baseTokens = exchange.swapIn(sideToken, baseToken, amount);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Incorporate a `minAmountOut` parameter. If there is not a specific amount received from the swap, then revert.
