# Vault Under-collateralization Due to Inaccurate Withdrawal Calculations in Yield Vault Strategies: in Vault.sol

## Summary
The **rescueShares** function in the Vault contract contains a vulnerability that allows users to withdraw assets at an inflated value by exploiting the outdated **epochPricePerShare** from the previous epoch, even after the Vault's strategies have incurred losses.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability in the code lies in the incorrect calculation of the withdrawal amount in the rescueShares function. Specifically, the code does not properly account for the correct price per share when calculating the new pending withdrawals. This can lead to a situation where the protocol becomes insolvent due to incorrect withdrawal calculations.

In line 574, the code calculates the new pending withdrawals using the shares to asset conversion function with the price per share from the previous epoch. However, in line 577, the withdrawal epoch is set to the previous epoch before completing the withdrawal. This means that the calculation of new pending withdrawals in line 574 is using the price per share from the previous epoch, but the withdrawal epoch is set to the previous epoch, which results in using the incorrect price per share for the calculation.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could perform the following steps:

1. Deposit a certain amount of shares into the contract.
2. Manipulate the price per share in a way that benefits the attacker.
3. Call the rescueShares function to initiate a withdrawal.
4. Due to the incorrect calculation of the new pending withdrawals based on the manipulated price per share, the attacker can withdraw more assets than they are entitled to.
5. Repeat the process multiple times to drain the protocol of its assets, leading to insolvency.

Proof of Concept (PoC) code:

```solidity
// Assume the attacker has control over the price per share
uint256 manipulatedPricePerShare = 1000;

// Deposit shares into the contract
function depositShares(uint256 amount) external {
    // Deposit shares into the contract
}

// Manipulate the price per share
function manipulatePricePerShare(uint256 price) external {
    manipulatedPricePerShare = price;
}

// Exploit the vulnerability by initiating a withdrawal with manipulated price per share
function exploit() external {
    // Call the rescueShares function to initiate a withdrawal
    rescueShares();
}

// Withdraw the assets
function withdrawAssets() external {
    // Withdraw the assets from the contract
}
```
By following the steps outlined in the PoC code, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability in the **rescueShares** function to withdraw more assets than they are entitled to, potentially leading to insolvency in the protocol.
## Impact
This can result in under-collateralization, as the amount of assets paid out to the withdrawing user may exceed the actual current value of their shares, leading to a socialization of losses among remaining users and potential protocol insolvency if exploited repeatedly before the price per share is corrected to reflect the true value of the underlying assets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, the code should be updated to use the pricePerShare from the current epoch instead of the previous epoch. This will ensure that the withdrawal amount is calculated based on the most up-to-date price per share.

Here is an example of a patch code to fix the vulnerability:

```solidity
557       function rescueShares() external isDead whenNotPaused {
558           VaultLib.Withdrawal storage withdrawal = withdrawals[msg.sender];
559           // If an uncompleted withdraw exists, complete it before starting a new one.
560           if (withdrawal.shares > 0) {
561               _completeWithdraw();
562           }
563   
564           // NOTE: it will revert if there are no shares to further withdraw.
565           _initiateWithdraw(0, true);
566   
567           // NOTE: due to the missing roll-epoch between the two withdraw phases, we have to:
568           //       - account the withdrawed shares as held.
569           //       - account the new pendingWithdrawals; due to the dead vault, we have to use the last price per share.
570           _state.withdrawals.newHeldShares -= withdrawal.shares;
571           _state.withdrawals.heldShares += withdrawal.shares;
572           Epoch memory epoch = getEpoch();
573           uint256 pricePerShare = epochPricePerShare[epoch.current]; // Updated to use current epoch price per share
574           uint256 newPendingWithdrawals = VaultLib.sharesToAsset(withdrawal.shares, pricePerShare, _shareDecimals);
575           _state.liquidity.pendingWithdrawals += newPendingWithdrawals;
576   
577           // NOTE: as the withdrawal.epoch is the epoch.current one, we also have to fake it in order to use the right price per share.
578           withdrawal.epoch = epoch.previous;
579   
580           _completeWithdraw();
581       }
```
By updating line 573 to use the **pricePerShare** from the current epoch, the vulnerability is mitigated and the correct withdrawal amount will be calculated based on the most recent price per share.
