# No expiration deadline leads to losing of funds

## Summary
The `_swapInSingle()` , `_swapInPath()`, `_swapOutSingle()`, `_swapOutPath()` in `UniswapAdapter.sol` does not set an expiration deadline, resulting in losing a lot of funds when swapping tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The deadline parameter in the `_swapInSingle()` and in other 3 function is set to block.timestamp. That means the function will accept a token swap at any block number (i.e., no expiration deadline).
```solidity
function _swapOutSingle(
        address tokenIn,
        address tokenOut,
        uint256 amountOut,
        uint256 amountMaximumIn
    ) private returns (uint256 amountIn) {
        ISwapRouter.ExactOutputSingleParams memory params = ISwapRouter.ExactOutputSingleParams(
            tokenIn,
            tokenOut,
            _DEFAULT_FEE,
            msg.sender,
            block.timestamp,
            amountOut,
            amountMaximumIn,
            _SQRTPRICELIMITX96
        );

        amountIn = _swapRouter.exactOutputSingle(params);
    }
```

## Impact
It may be more profitable for a miner to deny the transaction from being mined until the transaction incurs the maximum amount of slippage. A malicious miner can hold the transaction as deadline is set to block.timestamp which means that whenever the miner decides to include the transaction in a block, it will be valid at that time, since block.timestamp will be the current timestamp. The transaction might be left hanging in the mempool and be executed way later than the user wanted. The malicious miner can hold the transaction and execute the transaction only when he is profitable and no error would also be thrown as it will be valid at that time, since block.timestamp will be the current timestamp.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend setting the deadline parameter with a proper timestamp.
