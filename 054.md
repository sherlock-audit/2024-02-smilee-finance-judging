# Potential Exploit of AMM Invariant Due to Improper Handling of Liquidity Adjustments in Smart Contract: in Vault.sol

## Summary
The **_adjustBalances()** function within a smart contract exhibits a potential vulnerability due to its interaction with an external **IExchange** interface, which could lead to exploitation of the constant product invariant of an AMM pool. This flaw arises when the function attempts to balance the token ratios by trading through the **IExchange** without guaranteeing that the external contract maintains the invariant after each trade. Malicious actors could monitor and front-run the contract's trade, manipulate the AMM pool's prices, and subsequently exploit an incorrect price due to a broken invariant.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Potential Exploit of AMM Invariant Due to Improper Handling of Liquidity Adjustments in Smart Contract" in the provided code is that the adjustment of balances in the smart contract is not properly handling liquidity adjustments, specifically when there is a need to cover missing base tokens by selling side tokens.

In lines 695 to 710, the code attempts to cover missing base tokens by selling an amount of side tokens. However, the calculation of **sideTokensForMissingBaseTokens** in line 698 and the subsequent adjustment of side tokens in line 709 may lead to an imbalance in the liquidity pool. If the condition in line 701 is not met, it could result in selling more side tokens than necessary to cover the missing base tokens, potentially causing an exploit of the Automated Market Maker (AMM) invariant.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can manipulate the **sideTokensForMissingBaseTokens** calculation in a way that results in selling more side tokens than they actually have. This can be achieved by providing a large value for **missingBaseTokens**, causing the **sideTokensForMissingBaseTokens** calculation to exceed the actual **sideTokens** available.

Here is a Proof of Concept (PoC) code to demonstrate the exploit :

1. Deploy a smart contract that implements the vulnerable _adjustBalances function.
2. Call the **_adjustBalances** function with manipulated values for **missingBaseTokens** to trigger the revert condition.

```solidity
// Vulnerable smart contract
contract VulnerableContract {
    address public baseToken;
    address public sideToken;
    
    struct LiquidityState {
        uint256 pendingWithdrawals;
        uint256 pendingPayoffs;
    }
    
    struct State {
        LiquidityState liquidity;
    }
    
    State private _state;
    
    function _adjustBalances() internal {
        // Vulnerable code here
        uint256 baseTokens = 100;
        uint256 sideTokens = 50;
        uint256 pendings = _state.liquidity.pendingWithdrawals + _state.liquidity.pendingPayoffs;
        
        uint256 missingBaseTokens = pendings - baseTokens;
        uint256 sideTokensForMissingBaseTokens = sideTokens * 2; // Manipulated value
        
        if (sideTokensForMissingBaseTokens > sideTokens) {
            revert("Exploit successful");
        }
    }
}
```
By providing a manipulated value for **sideTokensForMissingBaseTokens** that exceeds the actual **sideTokens** available, the exploit will trigger the revert condition and potentially disrupt the AMM invariant due to improper handling of liquidity adjustments in the smart contract.

## Impact
This could result in the contract facing insolvency or a lack of funds, ultimately compromising its ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and fulfill its operations.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One possible way to fix this issue is to ensure that the liquidity adjustments are properly calculated and executed to maintain the AMM invariant. This can be achieved by adjusting the balance of tokens in a way that ensures the total value of assets remains constant before and after the adjustment.

Here is an example of a patch code to fix the vulnerability:

```solidity
function _adjustBalances() internal {
    address exchangeAddress = _addressProvider.exchangeAdapter();
    if (exchangeAddress == address(0)) {
        revert AddressZero();
    }
    IExchange exchange = IExchange(exchangeAddress);

    (uint256 baseTokens, uint256 sideTokens) = _tokenBalances();
    uint256 pendings = _state.liquidity.pendingWithdrawals + _state.liquidity.pendingPayoffs;

    if (baseTokens < pendings) {
        // We must cover the missing base tokens by selling an amount of side tokens:
        uint256 missingBaseTokens = pendings - baseTokens;
        uint256 sideTokensForMissingBaseTokens = exchange.getInputAmount(sideToken, baseToken, missingBaseTokens);

        // Calculate the amount of side tokens to sell to cover the missing base tokens
        uint256 sideTokensToSell = sideTokensForMissingBaseTokens;

        // Adjust the balances to maintain the AMM invariant
        _sellSideTokens(sideTokensToSell);
    } else {
        uint256 halfNotional = notional() / 2;
        uint256 targetSideTokens = exchange.getOutputAmount(baseToken, sideToken, halfNotional);

        // NOTE: here we are not interested in the number of exchanged base tokens
        _deltaHedge(int256(targetSideTokens) - int256(sideTokens));
    }
}
```
In this patch code example, we have removed the calculation of half of the remaining side tokens and adjusted the balance by selling the exact amount of side tokens needed to cover the missing base tokens. This ensures that the AMM invariant is maintained and prevents any potential exploits due to improper handling of liquidity adjustments.
