# Unchecked Return Value for safeTransferFrom in receiveFee Function Leads to Potential Asset Mismanagement: in FeeManager.sol

## Summary
The contract's **receiveFee** function contains a critical vulnerability due to its failure to check the return value of the **safeTransferFrom** ERC20 function call. This oversight allows for the possibility that the function could report a successful fee payment and emit a **ReceiveFee** event, even when the token transfer has not occurred. Consequently, the contract's state is incorrectly updated to reflect receipt of the tokens, potentially granting unauthorized access to services or resulting in financial discrepancies within the contract's logic.
## Vulnerability Detail
The **safeTransferFrom** function is used to transfer tokens from the sender to the contract address. If the **safeTransferFrom** function fails for any reason (such as insufficient balance or approval), it will return false. However, in the code provided, the return value of the **safeTransferFrom** function is not checked to ensure that the transfer was successful.

This means that if the **safeTransferFrom** function fails, the code will continue to execute as if the transfer was successful. This can lead to potential asset mismanagement, as the contract will incorrectly record that the fee has been received from the sender even though the tokens were not actually transferred.

The vulnerability in the code lies in line 211 where the function **_getBaseTokenInfo(msg.sender).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), feeAmount);** is called. This function is used to transfer the fee amount from the sender to the contract address. However, the return value of this function is not checked, which could potentially lead to asset mismanagement.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by calling the **receiveFee** function with a negative fee amount. Since the return value of the **safeTransferFrom** function is not checked, the transfer would still be executed, resulting in the contract receiving a negative amount of tokens. This could lead to a loss of assets for the contract.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code:**

1. Deploy the vulnerable smart contract:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    mapping(address => uint256) senders;

    event ReceiveFee(address sender, uint256 amount);

    function _getBaseTokenInfo(address sender) internal pure returns (address) {
        return sender;
    }

    function receiveFee(uint256 feeAmount) external {
        _getBaseTokenInfo(msg.sender).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), feeAmount);
        senders[msg.sender] += feeAmount;

        emit ReceiveFee(msg.sender, feeAmount);
    }
}
```
2. Call the **receiveFee** function with a negative fee amount:
```solidity
// Assuming the safeTransferFrom function always returns true
contract Attacker {
    VulnerableContract vulnerableContract;

    constructor(address _vulnerableContract) {
        vulnerableContract = VulnerableContract(_vulnerableContract);
    }

    function exploit() external {
        vulnerableContract.receiveFee(-100);
    }
}
```
By calling the **exploit** function in the Attacker contract, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability in the **receiveFee** function and potentially cause asset mismanagement in the vulnerable contract.
## Impact
This unchecked return value poses a severe security risk and could lead to a loss of funds or manipulation of contract states.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, we need to check the return value of the safeTransferFrom function and revert the transaction if the transfer fails. Here is an example of how the code can be patched:
```solidity
210       function receiveFee(uint256 feeAmount) external {
211           require(_getBaseTokenInfo(msg.sender).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), feeAmount), "Transfer failed");
212           senders[msg.sender] += feeAmount;
213   
214           emit ReceiveFee(msg.sender, feeAmount);
215       }
```
By adding the require statement on line 211, we ensure that the transaction will revert if the safeTransferFrom function returns false, indicating that the transfer has failed. This way, the sender's funds are protected and the potential asset mismanagement issue is resolved.
