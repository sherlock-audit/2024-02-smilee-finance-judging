# Potential Temporary Freezing of Funds Due to Slippage Check Failure in swapOut Function: in providers/SwapAdapterRouter.sol

## Summary
The **swapOut** function in the smart contract is vulnerable to the temporary freezing of user funds due to stringent slippage checks that can result in transaction reversion. If the actual amount of **tokenIn** used in the swap (**amountIn**) falls outside the calculated range between **amountInMin** and **amountInMax**, the function will revert with a **Slippage()** error.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the "Potential Temporary Freezing of Funds Due to Slippage Check Failure in **swapOut** Function" vulnerability in the provided code is that the funds transferred from the user to the contract are not immediately refunded if the slippage check fails.

In the **swapOut** function, the user approves a certain amount of tokens (**preApprovedAmountIn**) to be spent by the contract for the swap. If the swap results in an **amountIn** that is outside the acceptable range (**amountIn** < **amountInMin** or **amountIn** > **amountInMax**), the function reverts with a Slippage error. However, the funds that were transferred from the user to the contract in the **line 189** are not immediately refunded in this case.

This means that if the slippage check fails, the user's funds will be temporarily frozen in the contract until they trigger another transaction to withdraw the funds. This can lead to a situation where the user's funds are stuck in the contract and they are unable to retrieve them without taking additional action.

The vulnerability in the provided code lies in the **swapOut** function where there is a check for slippage in **lines 193 to 195**. If the **amountIn** returned by the **swapOut** function is less than **amountInMin** or greater than **amountInMax**, the transaction reverts due to slippage.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can manipulate the slippage check by providing a large **preApprovedAmountIn** that is significantly higher than the actual amount required for the swap. This will cause the **amountIn** returned by the **swapOut** function to be lower than expected, triggering the slippage check to fail and revert the transaction.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code:**

1. Attacker prepares a large **preApprovedAmountIn** for the swap:

```solidity
uint256 preApprovedAmountIn = 1000000; // Large amount for approval
```

2. Attacker calls the **swapOut** function with manipulated **preApprovedAmountIn**:
```solidity
swapOut(tokenIn, tokenOut, amountOut, preApprovedAmountIn);
```
3. The **swapOut** function will execute the swap with the large **preApprovedAmountIn**, causing the **amountIn** returned to be lower than expected.

4. As a result, the slippage check in lines 193 to 195 will fail, and the transaction will revert, potentially freezing the funds temporarily due to the slippage check failure.

By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can potentially disrupt the normal operation of the smart contract and cause temporary freezing of funds.

## Impact
This reversion locks the user's funds that were transferred to the contract, as they cannot be automatically refunded due to the conditional checks in place. Consequently, the funds remain inaccessible within the contract until manual intervention is executed to address the failed swap situation.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the provided code arises from the fact that the funds can be temporarily frozen if the slippage check fails in the **swapOut** function. This occurs because the funds are transferred to the contract in **line 189**, but if the slippage check fails in **line 193**, the funds are not refunded immediately, potentially leaving them locked in the contract.

To fix this issue, the funds should only be transferred to the contract after the slippage check has passed successfully. This way, if the check fails, the funds remain with the user and are not locked in the contract.

Here is the patched code example:

```solidity
176       function swapOut(
177           address tokenIn,
178           address tokenOut,
179           uint256 amountOut,
180           uint256 preApprovedAmountIn
181       ) external returns (uint256 amountIn) {
182           _zeroAddressCheck(tokenIn);
183           _zeroAddressCheck(tokenOut);
184           address adapter = _adapters[_encodePath(tokenIn, tokenOut)].get();
185           _zeroAddressCheck(adapter);
186   
187           (uint256 amountInMax, uint256 amountInMin) = _slippedValueIn(tokenIn, tokenOut, amountOut);
188   
189           IERC20Metadata(tokenIn).safeApprove(adapter, preApprovedAmountIn);
190           amountIn = ISwapAdapter(adapter).swapOut(tokenIn, tokenOut, amountOut, preApprovedAmountIn);
191   
192           if (amountIn < amountInMin || amountIn > amountInMax) {
193               revert Slippage();
194           }
195   
196           IERC20Metadata(tokenIn).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), preApprovedAmountIn);
197           IERC20Metadata(tokenOut).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amountOut);
198   
199           // If the actual amount spent (amountIn) is less than the specified maximum amount, we must refund the msg.sender
200           // Also reset approval in any case
201           IERC20Metadata(tokenIn).safeApprove(adapter, 0);
202           if (amountIn < preApprovedAmountIn) {
203               IERC20Metadata(tokenIn).safeTransfer(msg.sender, preApprovedAmountIn - amountIn);
204           }
205       }
```
In this patched code, the funds are only transferred to the contract after the slippage check has passed successfully. This ensures that if the check fails, the funds remain with the user and are not locked in the contract.
