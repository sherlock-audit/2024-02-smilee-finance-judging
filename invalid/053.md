# Griefing Vulnerability in Liquidity Pool Contract Allows Malicious Reset of User's LastActionTimestamp: in FeeManager.sol

## Summary
The **LiquidityPool.sol** smart contract is vulnerable to a griefing attack where an attacker can reset the **lastActionTimestamp** of a user by sending a trivial amount of LP tokens. This action triggers the **updateUserFeesOnDeposit()** function, which is not shown but is presumed to exist and update the user's withdrawal fee schedule. The negligible transfer does not significantly increase the user's withdrawal fee but does reset the timer on the fee decay schedule. This can extend the period during which the user has to pay higher withdrawal fees without a legitimate increase in the fee amount due to the small deposit. The vulnerability does not directly benefit the attacker financially but causes inconvenience and potential financial loss to the victim if they intend to withdraw their funds during the artificially extended higher fee period.

## Vulnerability Detail
Specifically, in lines 237 and 238, the function deducts the fee amount from the sender's balance and transfers the fee to the receiver without updating the sender's **lastActionTimestamp**. This means that an admin can repeatedly withdraw fees from a specific sender, effectively resetting their **lastActionTimestamp** each time and potentially disrupting the normal operation of the contract for that user.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the withdrawFee function where an admin can withdraw fees from a sender's account without checking if the sender has enough funds. This can be exploited by a malicious admin to continuously withdraw fees from a user's account, potentially draining their funds.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) :**

1. Deploy the smart contract with the vulnerable **withdrawFee** function.
2. Add an admin account that will exploit the vulnerability.
3. Add a user account with some funds in their account.
4. Call the **withdrawFee** function with the admin account as the receiver, the user account as the sender, and an amount higher than the user's balance.
5. Repeat step 4 multiple times to continuously withdraw fees from the user's account, potentially draining their funds.

By exploiting this vulnerability, the malicious admin can continuously withdraw fees from the user's account without their consent, leading to a potential loss of funds for the user.

## Impact
The maximum achievable impact of this vulnerability is the manipulation of user fee schedules, leading to an unfair extension of the timeline for fee reduction, which is both a nuisance and a potential financial detriment to affected users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, we can introduce a check in the **withdrawFee** function to ensure that the sender has not performed any action since the last fee withdrawal. This can be done by comparing the current timestamp with the sender's **lastActionTimestamp** and reverting the transaction if the sender has performed an action within the cooldown period.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to prevent the griefing vulnerability:

```solidity
231       function withdrawFee(address receiver, address sender, uint256 feeAmount) external {
232           _checkRole(ROLE_ADMIN);
233           if (senders[sender] < feeAmount) {
234               revert NoEnoughFundsFromSender();
235           }
236   
237           require(block.timestamp >= lastActionTimestamp[sender] + cooldownPeriod, "Cooldown period has not elapsed");
238   
239           senders[sender] -= feeAmount;
240           _getBaseTokenInfo(sender).safeTransfer(receiver, feeAmount);
241   
242           emit WithdrawFee(receiver, sender, feeAmount);
243       }
```
In the patched code, we added a **require** statement at line 237 to check if the cooldown period has elapsed since the sender's last action. If the cooldown period has not elapsed, the transaction will revert, preventing the admin from continuously withdrawing fees and resetting the user's **lastActionTimestamp**.
