# `ChainlinkPriceOracle::getTokenPrice`  doesn't check If Arbitrum sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
Chainlink recommends that all Optimistic L2 oracles consult the Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that the sequencer is live before trusting the data returned by the oracle. This check is skipped in [ChainlinkPriceOracle.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/providers/chainlink/ChainlinkPriceOracle.sol)

## Vulnerability Detail
If the Arbitrum Sequencer goes down, oracle data will not be kept up to date, and thus could become stale. However, users are able to continue to interact with the protocol directly through the contract. You can review Chainlink docs on [L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds/) for more details on this.

As a result, users may be able to use the protocol while oracle feeds are stale.

## Impact
If the `Arbitrum` sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow users to continue to operate at the previous (stale) rates.
