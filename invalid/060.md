# Inaccurate Accounting and Potential Insolvency Due to Fee-on-Transfer Token Handling: in Vault.sol

## Summary
The **deposit** function in the provided smart contract is vulnerable to incorrect accounting due to its inability to handle fee-on-transfer ERC20 tokens. When these tokens are used, the actual amount received by the contract post-transfer can be less than the **amount** specified by the sender, owing to the fee deduction. The contract fails to account for this reduced amount when updating **_state.liquidity.totalDeposit** and **_state.liquidity.pendingDeposits**, leading to inflated deposit balances within the contract's state.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Inaccurate Accounting and Potential Insolvency Due to Fee-on-Transfer Token Handling" in the provided code is that the totalDeposit and pendingDeposits are updated before the transfer of tokens is completed. This can lead to inaccurate accounting of the actual token balances in the contract, potentially causing insolvency if the contract relies on these balances for other operations.

Specifically, in lines 342 to 344, the contract updates the pendingDeposits and totalDeposit variables before the tokens are actually transferred from the sender to the contract in line 346. If the transfer fails for any reason after these variables are updated, the contract will have incorrect accounting of the deposited tokens, which can lead to insolvency if the contract relies on these balances for other operations.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the inaccurate accounting of the total deposit amount. The code does not properly handle the fee-on-transfer tokens, which can lead to potential insolvency if the total deposit amount is not accurately calculated.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can create a fee-on-transfer token where a percentage of the transfer amount is burned or sent to another address. By depositing a large amount of this fee-on-transfer token, the attacker can manipulate the total deposit amount calculation in the smart contract.

Here is a Proof of Concept (PoC) code to demonstrate how the vulnerability could be exploited:

1. Create a fee-on-transfer token contract with a transfer fee of 10%:
```solidity
contract FeeOnTransferToken {
    string public name = "FeeOnTransferToken";
    string public symbol = "FOT";
    uint8 public decimals = 18;
    uint256 public totalSupply = 1000000 * 10 ** uint256(decimals);
    uint256 public transferFee = 10; // 10%

    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);

    constructor() {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public returns (bool) {
        uint256 fee = value * transferFee / 100;
        uint256 newValue = value - fee;

        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= value;
        balanceOf[to] += newValue;
        totalSupply -= fee;

        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, newValue);
        return true;
    }
}
```
2. Deploy the **FeeOnTransferToken** contract and obtain the token address.
3. Exploit the vulnerability in the deposit function of the smart contract by depositing a large amount of the fee-on-transfer token:

```solidity
// Assuming the FeeOnTransferToken address is stored in feeOnTransferTokenAddress
FeeOnTransferToken token = FeeOnTransferToken(feeOnTransferTokenAddress);

// Deposit a large amount of the fee-on-transfer token
uint256 amount = 1000000 * 10 ** uint256(token.decimals);
contractInstance.deposit(amount, attackerAddress, accessTokenId);
```
By depositing a large amount of the fee-on-transfer token with a transfer fee, the attacker can manipulate the total deposit amount calculation in the smart contract, potentially leading to inaccurate accounting and insolvency.
## Impact
This vulnerability could potentially be exploited, resulting in the protocol becoming insolvent or failing to meet its return obligations to users, as it may operate under the false assumption that it has more funds than it truly possesses.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the provided code is related to the inaccurate accounting of the total deposit amount. The issue arises when the total deposit amount is calculated based on the pending deposits without considering the fee-on-transfer mechanism of the token. This can lead to potential insolvency if the total deposit amount does not accurately reflect the actual balance of the contract due to token transfers.

To fix this issue, the total deposit amount should be updated based on the actual balance of the contract after the token transfer. One way to address this is to calculate the actual deposit amount received after the token transfer and update the total deposit amount accordingly.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to address the vulnerability:
```solidity
324       function deposit(uint256 amount, address receiver, uint256 accessTokenId) external isNotDead whenNotPaused {
325           _checkEpochNotFinished();
326   
327           if (amount == 0) {
328               revert AmountZero();
329           }
330   
331           // Avoids underflows when the maxDeposit is set below the totalDeposit
332           if (_state.liquidity.totalDeposit > maxDeposit) {
333               revert ExceedsMaxDeposit();
334           }
335   
336           if (amount > maxDeposit - _state.liquidity.totalDeposit) {
337               revert ExceedsMaxDeposit();
338           }
339   
340           _usePriorityAccess(amount, receiver, accessTokenId);
341   
342           _state.liquidity.pendingDeposits += amount;
343   
344           IERC20(baseToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
345   
346           uint256 actualAmountReceived = amount - calculateFee(amount); // Calculate the actual amount received after fee deduction
347           _state.liquidity.totalDeposit += actualAmountReceived; // Update total deposit amount with actual amount received
348   
349           _emitUpdatedDepositReceipt(receiver, actualAmountReceived);
350   
351           emit Deposit(actualAmountReceived);
352       }
```
In the patched code, we calculate the actual amount received after deducting any fees and update the total deposit amount based on this actual amount. This ensures that the total deposit amount accurately reflects the balance of the contract after the token transfer, addressing the vulnerability related to inaccurate accounting and potential insolvency.
