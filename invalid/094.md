# Only admin can set swap slippage in SwapAdapterRouter, instead of users

## Summary
Rather than users being able to set slippage for swaps, only the admin can set it. This can lead to issues where admin does not set enough slippage and due to high votality, users will not be able to swap.

## Vulnerability Detail
Although admins are trusted, and issues with admin trust is usually considered out of scope, this is not relevant to that. It's the fact that slippage cannot be set by users. Users must comply to the slippage set by admins, which can cause various issues.

As mentioned in the summary, only admins can set slippage for swaps in the `SwapAdapterRouter.sol` contract. This can lead to cases where the admin does not set enough slippage, which will cause a denial of service for the swaps, especially during high votality.

It can also lead to loss of funds if the admin sets too little slippage. Read [this](https://defihacklabs.substack.com/p/solidity-security-lesson-6-defi-slippage?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2#:~:text=Developers%20should%20ensure%20%26%20auditors%20must%20verify%20that%20users%20are%20allowed%20to%20specify%20their%20own%20slippage%20parameters%20which%20were%20calculated%20off%2Dchain.) for more information on slippage and the importance of always letting users set their own slippage.
 
## Impact
Denial of service/loss of funds.

## Code Snippet
`SwapAdapterRouter::setSlippage` [#L100-110](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/providers/SwapAdapterRouter.sol#L100-L110)
```javascript
    function setSlippage(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 slippage) external {
@>      _checkRole(ROLE_ADMIN);

        if (slippage < 0.005e18 || slippage > 0.1e18) {
            revert OutOfAllowedRange();
        }

        _slippage[_encodePath(tokenIn, tokenOut)].set(slippage, timeLockDelay);

        emit ChangedSlippage(tokenIn, tokenOut, slippage);
    }

```

To retrieve this slippage:
`SwapAdapterRouter::getSlippage` [#L70-77](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/providers/SwapAdapterRouter.sol#L70-L77)
```javascript
    function getSlippage(address tokenIn, address tokenOut) public view returns (uint256 slippage) {
        slippage = _slippage[_encodePath(tokenIn, tokenOut)].get();

        // Default baseline value:
        if (slippage == 0) {
            return 0.02e18;
        }
    }
```

The above function is called multiple times throughout the `SwapAdapterRouter.sol` contract to get the slippage for swaps, which was set by an admin.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow users to specify their own slippage parameters.
