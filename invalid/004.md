# The absence of a transaction expiration check may cause tokens to be sold at a price below their market value.

## Summary
The sale of tokens in _swapOutSingle and _swapOutPath functions does not include a check for transaction expiration, which could result in the reward tokens being sold at a price below the market value at the time of the swap. This scenario may lead to gamers and depositors earning a lower yield than anticipated.

## Vulnerability Detail
The  _swapOutSingle and _swapOutPath function, tasked with facilitating token sales on Uniswap, assigns deadline parameter to block.timestamp. This essentially nullifies the transaction expiration verification, as the deadline is determined by the timestamp of the block that processes the transaction.

Uniswap implements a transaction expiration mechanism through the deadline parameter, enabling users to avoid selling tokens at a price that may be outdated and below the prevailing market rate. Consider the following scenario:

A transaction is executed on the Ethereum mainnet.
Prior to the transaction being confirmed, there is a sharp rise in gas costs, causing the transaction to linger in the mempool due to its gas fee being less than the ongoing rate.
As the transaction waits in the mempool, the price of the reward token sees an increase.
Subsequently, as gas costs decrease, the transaction gets confirmed. Given that the amountOutMinimum value was predicated on a now outdated and lower reward token price, a MEV bot exploits this by performing a sandwich attack. The bot manipulates the token's price in the Uniswap pool to ensure the transaction still meets the minimum output amount criteria, profiting from the swap executed at a diminished rate.
The aftermath of the sandwich attack leaves tokens exchanged at an obsolete price, currently below the tokens' market value. Consequently, the protocol, along with gamers and depositors, secures a lower yield than what would have been attainable had the tokens been sold at the up-to-date price.

## Impact
Trading tokens is vulnerable to sandwich attacks, potentially leading to gamers and depositors earning a reduced yield because the tokens might be sold at a price that no longer reflects the current market value

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Think about setting a sensible value for the deadline parameter. For instance, Uniswap configures this to be 30 minutes for transactions on the Ethereum mainnet and 5 minutes for Layer 2 networks.
