# Return values of ERC20::transfer function is not checked in both redeem and initiateWithdraws

## Summary
Code does not handle ERC20 tokens with special transfer implementation . Calls to ERC20::transfer method should always be checked as specified in the EIP-20. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens do not revert on failure in transfer but instead return false as a return value. Because of this it has become a common practice to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 to handle such weird tokens. If transfer fails, but does not revert it can leave tokens stuck in the contract . If this becomes the case, the vault accounting in _redeem_ might be flawed if such a weird ERC20 token is used as the vault shares.

The same issue persists in the _initiateWithdraw_ function of the vault contract..

## Impact
The impact, potentially, is a permanently lost ( stuck) value for users of the protocol who utilizes such a weird ERC20 token. However, since this needs a special token to be used as the underlying share of the vault, or to be sent into the contract by mistake, I deemed this a medium-severity .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use Openzeppelin's SafeERC20 functions to handle the transfer of such tokens. Implement safeTransfer or safeTransferFrom functions in the SafeERC20 contract in these portions of the code, just as you implemented in the burn and mint operations of the dvp contract.
