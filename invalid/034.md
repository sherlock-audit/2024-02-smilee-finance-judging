# Zero and unequal up and down `amount` passes through checks which  may have some parasite effect

## Summary
inside `_burn()` function at `DVP.sol` , there are certian checks which which ensures that
1.  zero amount is not passed  , because passing of zero amount can cause some parasite effect .
2. in case unequal amount.up and amount.down , only position manager is allowed to procced .

still it pasees through when :
(amount.up = 0 && amount.down !=0 )  or (amount.up != 0 && amount.down ==0 ) . 
Which voilates both the checks .

## Vulnerability Detail

In the code below 
```solidity 
        
        //check1
         if (amount.up == 0 && amount.down == 0) {
            // NOTE: a zero amount may have some parasite effect, henct we proactively protect against it.
            revert AmountZero();
        }
        
       //check2
        if (amount.up > position.amountUp || amount.down > position.amountDown) {
            revert CantBurnMoreThanMinted();
        }
        
        //check3
        if ((amount.up > 0 && amount.down > 0) && (amount.up != amount.down)) {
            // If amount is an unbalanced smile, only the position manager is allowed to proceed:
            if (msg.sender != _addressProvider.dvpPositionManager()) {
                revert OnlyPositionManager();
            }
        }
```

when `(amount.up = 0 && amount.down !=0 )  or (amount.up != 0 && amount.down ==0 ) . `
-> check 1 passes , as one of them is false 
-> check 2 also passes for above condition
-> check 3 also passes the condition `(amount.up > 0 && amount.down > 0) = false ` , so even for unbalanced amount , check 3 passes where only position manager was allowed to proceed .
