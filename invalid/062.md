# Asset Withdrawal Miscalculation due to Unchecked Locked Funds: in Vault.sol

## Summary
The **_completeWithdraw** function in the smart contract is vulnerable due to its failure to account for locked or frozen funds when calculating the withdrawal amount based on the users' shares. This can result in users receiving less than the true value of their shares if the **epochPricePerShare** used in the calculation does not reflect the actual value of the assets at the time of withdrawal. The vulnerability arises from the function's reliance on **pricePerShare** without validating the presence of locked funds, potentially leading to a discrepancy between the burned shares and the amount transferred to the user.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of this vulnerability in the provided code is that the function **_completeWithdraw()** does not check if the user has enough shares available to withdraw the requested amount.

In line 542, the code calculates the **amountToWithdraw** based on the shares the user wants to withdraw and the **pricePerShare**. However, in line 546, it deducts the shares directly from the **heldShares** without verifying if the user actually has those shares available. This can lead to a situation where the user tries to withdraw more shares than they actually have, resulting in a miscalculation of the amount to be withdrawn.The root cause of the "Asset Withdrawal Miscalculation due to Unchecked Locked Funds" vulnerability in the provided code is that the function **_completeWithdraw()** does not check if the user has enough shares available to withdraw the requested amount.

In line 542, the code calculates the **amountToWithdraw** based on the shares the user wants to withdraw and the **pricePerShare**. However, in line 546, it deducts the shares directly from the **heldShares** without verifying if the user actually has those shares available. This can lead to a situation where the user tries to withdraw more shares than they actually have, resulting in a miscalculation of the amount to be withdrawn.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the fact that the amount of shares to be withdrawn is calculated based on the current price per share at the time of withdrawal. However, the user's shares are deducted from the total held shares before the transfer of assets is made. This can lead to a miscalculation if the price per share changes between the time the shares are deducted and the assets are transferred.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can perform the following steps:

1. Deposit a certain amount of shares into the contract.
2. Wait for the price per share to increase significantly.
3. Initiate a withdrawal of the shares.
4. Before the withdrawal is completed, perform a transaction that changes the price per share to a lower value.
5. The withdrawal will then be completed based on the outdated higher price per share, resulting in the attacker receiving more assets than they should.

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**

```solidity
// Assume the attacker has control over the price per share
uint256 maliciousPricePerShare = 1000; // Set a higher price per share

// Deposit shares into the contract
depositShares(100); // Deposit 100 shares

// Wait for the price per share to increase
// Assume the price per share has increased to 2000

// Initiate a withdrawal
initiateWithdrawal();

// Perform a transaction to change the price per share to a lower value
maliciousPricePerShare = 500; // Set a lower price per share

// The withdrawal will be completed based on the outdated higher price per share
// Attacker will receive more assets than they should
```
By following these steps, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability in the code and withdraw more assets than they are entitled to due to the miscalculation caused by the unchecked locked funds.

## Impact
This could cause financial loss to users and undermine the integrity of the contract's withdrawal mechanism.

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, one possible solution is to store the price per share at the time of withdrawal initiation and use that value to calculate the amount of assets to be withdrawn. This way, the calculation will be based on a consistent price per share throughout the withdrawal process.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to address this vulnerability:

```solidity
539       function _completeWithdraw() internal {
540           VaultLib.Withdrawal storage withdrawal = withdrawals[msg.sender];
541   
542           uint256 pricePerShare = withdrawal.pricePerShare; // Use the stored price per share
543           uint256 amountToWithdraw = VaultLib.sharesToAsset(withdrawal.shares, pricePerShare, _shareDecimals);
544   
545           // NOTE: the user transferred the required shares to the vault when (s)he initiated the withdraw
546           _state.withdrawals.heldShares -= withdrawal.shares;
547           _state.liquidity.pendingWithdrawals -= amountToWithdraw;
548   
549           uint256 sharesToWithdraw = withdrawal.shares;
550           withdrawal.shares = 0;
551           _burn(address(this), sharesToWithdraw);
552           IERC20(baseToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amountToWithdraw);
553   
554           emit Withdraw(amountToWithdraw);
555       }
```
In this patched code, we have added a new field **pricePerShare** to the **Withdrawal** struct where the price per share at the time of withdrawal initiation is stored. This value is then used to calculate the amount of assets to be withdrawn in a consistent manner.
