# No check if Arbitrum L2 sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
When employing Chainlink on Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum, it's crucial to verify the operational status of the sequencer to prevent relying on price data that appears current but is actually outdated.
This vulnerability could be exploited by attackers to benefit from periods when the sequencer is offline.

## Vulnerability Detail
Only  _getFeedValue function to get the price, there is no check that the sequencer is down
```solidity
function _getFeedValue(address priceFeedAddr) internal view returns (OracleValue memory datum) {
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(priceFeedAddr);
        /*
            latestRoundData SHOULD raise "No data present"
            if they do not have data to report, instead of returning unset values
            which could be misinterpreted as actual reported values.
        */
        (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();      

        if (answer < 0) {
            revert PriceNegative();
        }

        datum.value = AmountsMath.wrapDecimals(uint256(answer), priceFeed.decimals());
        datum.lastUpdate = updatedAt;
    }
```

## Impact
If Arbitrum sequencer experiences downtime, the protocol will enable users to transact using the outdated (stale) prices.
