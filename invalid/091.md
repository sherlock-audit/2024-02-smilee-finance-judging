# Denial of Service if token oracle goes down

## Summary
The `SwapAdapterRouter.sol`, `DVP.sol`, and `IG.sol` contracts will encounter denial of service if a chainlink price oracle goes down.

Throughout many instances of these contracts, the chainlink price oracle is called to get the value of tokens. However, in some extreme cases, oracles can be taken offline. This will cause any calls to the oracle to revert, which will cause a total denial of service to these contracts (users will not be able to swap or interact with options).

## Vulnerability Detail
As mentioned in the summary, chainlink price oracles can be taken offline in extreme case. This is known to happen during the `UST` collapse.

The `SwapAdapterRouter.sol` contract references the Chainlink price oracle and check the swaps against the oracle prices, accepting a maximum slippage that can be set for every pair.

The `DVP.sol` (Decentralized Volatility Product) and `IG.sol` contracts are used for options on volatility. Users can interact with these contracts for creating, pricing, and settling options.

These functionalities are an important part of the Smilee protocol. If the price oracle of an asset goes down, then these contracts will suffer from denial of service and users will not be able to interact with them.

## Impact
Denial of service `SwapAdapterRouter.sol`, `DVP.sol`, and `IG.sol` contracts

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Perhaps implement a `try/catch` block to handle the case if the oracle fails.
