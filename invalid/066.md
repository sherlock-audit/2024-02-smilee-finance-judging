# Overflow Vulnerability

## Summary
The function `increase() ` perform arithmetic operations directly on the struct members `up` and `down` without  proper overflow checks.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's think to clarify, we have an instance of the `Amount` struct with `up` and `down` initialized to the maximum possible value of `uint256`, as below - 
```solidity
AmountHelper.Amount storage amount;
amount.up = type(uint256).max;
amount.down = type(uint256).max;
```
Now try to increase up or down by a value greater than `type(uint256).max`, an overflow will occur, 

```solidity
AmountHelper.increase(amount, AmountHelper.Amount(type(uint256).max, 1));
```

After this operation, `amount.up ` will wrap around to `0` due to overflow, leading to unintended behavior or loss of funds.



## Impact

Integer overflow can result in serious circumstances, it certainly leading to loss of funds or denial of service.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
library AmountHelper {


    /**
        @notice Increase amount.
        @param amount the increased amount.
     */
    function increase(Amount storage self, Amount memory amount) external {
        self.up += amount.up;
        self.down += amount.down;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement checks for overflow using **SafeMath** library

```solidity
import "./SafeMath.sol";  // Import SafeMath library

library AmountHelper {
    using SafeMath for uint256;  // Use SafeMath for uint256 type

    struct Amount {
        uint256 up;
        uint256 down;
    }

    function increase(Amount storage self, Amount memory amount) external {
        self.up += amount.up; 
        self.down += amount.down; 
    }
```
