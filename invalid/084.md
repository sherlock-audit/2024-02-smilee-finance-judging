# Possible loss of shares

## Summary
When a user redeems their shares, the transaction can silently fail, leading to a loss of shares.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol explicitly states that `"Smilee can work with any ERC20 tokens."`

When redeeming shares, ERC20's `_transfer` is used instead of `safeTransfer`. Some ERC20 Tokens do not revert on failure of the transfer function, but return a bool value instead. This can cause the transaction to silently fail instead of reverting. It is required to check if a value was returned, and if true, which value it is. 

## Impact
Possible loss of shares for users

```javascript

`Vault::_initiateWithdraw` [#L455-518](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L455-L518)
```javascript
    function _initiateWithdraw(uint256 shares, bool isMax) internal {
        // We take advantage of this flow in order to also transfer any unredeemed share to the user.
        _redeem(0, true);
        // NOTE: since we made a 'redeem all', from now on all the user's shares are owned by him.
        uint256 userShares = balanceOf(msg.sender);

        if (isMax) {
            shares = userShares;
        }

        if (shares == 0) {

        }

        if (shares > userShares) {

        Epoch memory epoch = getEpoch();

        // If there is a pre-ordered withdrawal in the past, the user must first complete it.

            revert ExistingIncompleteWithdraw();
        }

        // Update user withdrawal receipt:
        // NOTE: the withdrawal.shares value is zeroed when the user complete a withdraw.
        // NOTE: if there is a pre-ordered withdrawal in the current epoch, it is increased; otherwise it starts from zero.
        withdrawal.shares = withdrawal.shares + shares;
        withdrawal.epoch = epoch.current;

        // -----------------------------
        // A withdrawal pre-order free space for further deposits, hence we must
        // update the vault capacity.
        //
        // The deposit receipt must also be updated in order to correctly update
        // the vault total deposits, shall the user initiate other withdrawal
        // pre-orders in the same epoch (as it is used for such computation).
        //
        // Steps:
        //   - estimate the increased capacity by computing the following proportion:
        //       withdrawed_shares : user_shares = x : user_deposits
        //   - use the found number for decreasing the current number of deposits.
        //   - update the user's deposit receipt [cumulativeAmount] value.
        VaultLib.DepositReceipt storage depositReceipt = depositReceipts[msg.sender];
        // NOTE: the user deposits to consider are only the ones for which a share has been minted.
        uint256 userDeposits = depositReceipt.cumulativeAmount;
        if (depositReceipt.epoch == epoch.current) {
            userDeposits -= depositReceipt.amount;
        }

        uint256 withdrawDepositEquivalent = (userDeposits * shares) / userShares;

        _state.liquidity.totalDeposit -= withdrawDepositEquivalent;
        depositReceipt.cumulativeAmount -= withdrawDepositEquivalent;
        // -----------------------------

        _state.withdrawals.newHeldShares += shares;

@>      _transfer(msg.sender, address(this), shares);

        emit InitiateWithdraw(shares);
    }
```

`ERC20::_transfer` for reference:
```javascript
    function _transfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal virtual {
        require(from != address(0), "ERC20: transfer from the zero address");
        require(to != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to the zero address");

        _beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);

        uint256 fromBalance = _balances[from];
        require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance");
        unchecked {
            _balances[from] = fromBalance - amount;
            // Overflow not possible: the sum of all balances is capped by totalSupply, and the sum is preserved by
            // decrementing then incrementing.
            _balances[to] += amount;
        }

        emit Transfer(from, to, amount);

        _afterTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
    }
```
