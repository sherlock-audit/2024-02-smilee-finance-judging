# Insufficient Slippage Handling for Withdrawals

## Summary
In the `_completeWithdraw` function, the code assumes that the amount of base tokens to be withdrawn (`amountToWithdraw`) can be transferred to the user without considering potential slippage during the token swap.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L539

```solidity
function _completeWithdraw() internal {
    VaultLib.Withdrawal storage withdrawal = withdrawals[msg.sender];

    uint256 pricePerShare = epochPricePerShare[withdrawal.epoch];
    uint256 amountToWithdraw = VaultLib.sharesToAsset(withdrawal.shares, pricePerShare, _shareDecimals);

    // NOTE: the user transferred the required shares to the vault when (s)he initiated the withdraw
    _state.withdrawals.heldShares -= withdrawal.shares;
    _state.liquidity.pendingWithdrawals -= amountToWithdraw;

    uint256 sharesToWithdraw = withdrawal.shares;
    withdrawal.shares = 0;
    _burn(address(this), sharesToWithdraw);
    IERC20(baseToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amountToWithdraw);

    emit Withdraw(amountToWithdraw);
}
```

If there is slippage during the token swap required to obtain the `amountToWithdraw` of base tokens, the `IERC20(baseToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amountToWithdraw)` line will revert, leaving the user's withdrawal in an inconsistent state.

## Impact
For example, if Bob initiates a withdrawal of 5000 assets (base tokens), and the contract expects to receive 5000 base tokens after the token swap, but due to slippage, it only receives 4999 base tokens, the `safeTransfer` will revert, leaving the user's withdrawal in limbo.
