# No check for active L2 Sequencer

## Summary
Using Chainlink in L2 chains such as Arbitrum requires to check if the sequencer is down to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not according to their [recommendation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#arbitrum)

## Vulnerability Detail
[ChainlinkPriceOracle._getFeedValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/3241f1bf0c8e951a41dd2e51997f64ef3ec017bd/smilee-v2-contracts/src/providers/chainlink/ChainlinkPriceOracle.sol#L110-L125) calls `Chainlink's latestRoundData`, but `ChainlinkPriceOracle._getFeedValue` doesn't check if the sequencer is down.

## Impact
If the sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow users to continue to operate at the staled price
