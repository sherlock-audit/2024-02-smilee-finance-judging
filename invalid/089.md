# Missing check for active L2 Sequencer

## Summary
The protocol mentions that it will be deployed on Arbitrum, and in the future it will be deployed on additional Ethereum L2s. Using chainlink on L2s require checking if the sequencer is down, to avoid using stale prices, which this protocol currently does not do.

## Vulnerability Detail
As mentioned in the summary, The protocol explicitly states that it will be deployed on `Arbitrum`, and perhaps addition Ethereum L2s. This follows the exception for the `Chain re-org and network liveness related issues are not considered valid` rule for sherlock judging, making this a valid issue.

The protocol does not have a check to see if the L2 sequencer is active or not. Since it will be deployed on L2s like Arbitrum, the protocol can suffer from losses by using stale prices from Chainklink Price Oracles.

## Impact
If the sequencer goes down, users/contracts relying on the Chainlink Price Oracle can be impacted and malicious actors can take advantage of this.
