# Rounding Errors in Conversion from Asset Amount to Shares

## Summary
See below.
## Vulnerability Detail
The  `getSharesFromReceipt` function in the `VaultLib` library calculates the unredeemed shares for a given deposit receipt.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/lib/VaultLib.sol#L112

```solidity
function getSharesFromReceipt(
    DepositReceipt calldata depositReceipt,
    uint256 currentEpoch,
    uint256 sharePrice,
    uint8 tokenDecimals
) external pure returns (uint256 unredeemedShares) {
    if (depositReceipt.epoch == 0 || depositReceipt.epoch == currentEpoch) {
        return depositReceipt.unredeemedShares;
    }

    uint256 sharesFromRound = assetToShares(depositReceipt.amount, sharePrice, tokenDecimals);
    return depositReceipt.unredeemedShares + sharesFromRound;
}
```

The `assetToShares` function performs the conversion from asset amount to shares:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/lib/VaultLib.sol#L57

```solidity
function assetToShares(uint256 assetAmount, uint256 sharePrice, uint8 tokenDecimals) public pure returns (uint256) {
    // If sharePrice goes to zero, the asset cannot minted, this means the assetAmount is to rescue
    if (sharePrice == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    if (assetAmount == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    return (assetAmount * 10 ** tokenDecimals) / sharePrice;
}
```

## Impact
The division operation `(assetAmount * 10 ** tokenDecimals) / sharePrice` can result in rounding errors, especially when `assetAmount` is small compared to the `sharePrice`. This rounding error can lead to the `sharesFromRound` value being rounded down to zero, effectively nullifying the user's deposit and making them unable to claim any shares.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Introduce a minimum deposit amount that is sufficiently large to avoid rounding errors when converting to shares. This would prevent users from depositing very small amounts that could be rounded down to zero shares.

- Instead of rounding down the `sharesFromRound` value, you could round up or implement a precision loss compensation mechanism. This would ensure that even small deposits are accounted for and users receive their fair share of tokens.
