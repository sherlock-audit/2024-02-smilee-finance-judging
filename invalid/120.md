# `ChainlinkPriceOracle`: no check if Arbitrum L2 sequencer is down

## Summary

The protocol is supposed to be deployed initially on Arbitrum, then later on other L2s, and when using Chainlink price feeds in L2 chains; the sequencer must be checked if it's down to prevent using stale prices.

## Vulnerability Detail

`ChainlinkPriceOracle.getTokenPrice` function is used to extract the price of an asset in USD, but it was noted that there's no check if the sequencer is down before consuming the returned price, which might result in using stale returned prices when the sequencer is down,

## Impact

This could result in using invalid/stale prices.

## Code Snippet

[ChainlinkPriceOracle.getTokenPrice function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/3241f1bf0c8e951a41dd2e51997f64ef3ec017bd/smilee-v2-contracts/src/providers/chainlink/ChainlinkPriceOracle.sol#L90C5-L108C6)

```javascript
function getTokenPrice(address token) public view returns (uint256) {
        if (token == address(0)) {
            revert AddressZero();
        }

        address priceFeed = feeds[token].get();
        if (priceFeed == address(0)) {
            revert TokenNotSupported();
        }

        OracleValue memory price = _getFeedValue(priceFeed);

        // Protect against stale feeds:
        if (block.timestamp - price.lastUpdate > getPriceFeedMaxDelay(token)) {
            revert PriceTooOld();
        }

        return price.value;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use sequencer oracle to determine whether the sequencer is offline or not, and revert `getTokenPrice()` if the sequencer is offline ([link](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code)).
