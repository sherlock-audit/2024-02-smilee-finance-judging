# Share Price Inflation due to Accumulated Shares

## Summary
The share price is calculated using the `VaultLib.pricePerShare` function, which computes the price based on the `lockedLiquidity` (the total portfolio value) and the `outstandingShares` (the total supply of shares minus the held shares for withdrawals).

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function _beforeRollEpoch() internal virtual override isNotDead {
    // ...

    uint256 lockedLiquidity = notional();

    // [IL-NOTE]
    // In rare scenarios (ex. roundings or very tiny TVL vaults with high impact swap slippage) there can be small losses in a single epoch.
    // As a precautionary design we plan to revert and have the protocol DAO / admin cover such tiny amount.
    // Managing such scenarios at code level would increase codebase complexity without bringing any real benefit to the protocol.
    if (lockedLiquidity < _state.liquidity.newPendingPayoffs) {
        revert InsufficientLiquidity(
            bytes4(keccak256("_beforeRollEpoch()::lockedLiquidity <= _state.liquidity.newPendingPayoffs"))
        );
    }

    // NOTE: the share price needs to account also the payoffs
    lockedLiquidity -= _state.liquidity.newPendingPayoffs;

    // Computes the share price for the ending epoch:
    // - heldShares are the ones given back to the Vault in exchange of withdrawed tokens
    // - lockedLiquidity is the DVP portfolio value at the end of the epoch
    uint256 outstandingShares = totalSupply() - _state.withdrawals.heldShares;

    // NOTE: the share price cannot go to zero unless `_state.liquidity.newPendingPayoffs` is exactly equal to `lockedLiquidity`
    // - when all the locked liquidity is set aside for (pending) withdrawals and payoffs (lockedLiquidity = 0, we revert)
    // - when everyone withdrew, or during first epoch, `outstandingShares` is 0 -> sharePrice = 1
    uint256 sharePrice = VaultLib.pricePerShare(lockedLiquidity, outstandingShares, _shareDecimals);
    epochPricePerShare[getEpoch().current] = sharePrice;

    // ...
}
```

## Impact
The `lockedLiquidity` includes the accumulated portfolio value from the destination vaults. If the `outstandingShares` is relatively small due to users redeeming most of their shares (leaving only a dust amount of shares) the ratio of `lockedLiquidity` to `outstandingShares` can become severely inflated, leading to an abnormally high share price.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a minimum share supply threshold that must be maintained at all times. If the total supply of shares falls below this threshold, certain operations (e.g., redeeming shares, initiating withdrawals) could be disabled or restricted to prevent the share price from becoming excessively inflated.
