# Underreported User Staking Balance Due to Exclusion of Pending BAKC Token Rewards: in Vault.sol

## Summary
The **getTokenIdStakingAmount()** function within the **NTokenApeStaking** contracts fails to include pending BAKC token rewards in the user's total stake amount calculation. This omission leads to an underreporting of the user's true collateral value when queried through **balanceOf()**. As a consequence, users may not be able to borrow the full amount they are entitled to based on their actual collateral, which includes unaccounted-for BAKC rewards, potentially impacting the integrity of lending operations on the platform.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability in the code is that the **notional()** function does not take into account the pending BAKC token rewards when calculating the user's staking balance. This can lead to an underreported staking balance for users who have pending BAKC token rewards that have not been accounted for in the calculation.

The function calculates the notional value by adding the base tokens and the value of side tokens obtained from the exchange. However, it does not consider any pending BAKC token rewards that the user may have earned but not yet received. 

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**

1. Assume a scenario where a user has staked a certain amount of tokens in the smart contract and has also earned some BAKC token rewards that are pending.
2. The notional() function is called to calculate the user's staking balance.
3. The function calculates the baseTokens and sideTokens staked by the user, but it does not consider the pending BAKC token rewards.
4. As a result, the function returns a value that does not include the pending BAKC token rewards, leading to an underreported staking balance for the user.

**Exploitation:**

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by staking a certain amount of tokens in the smart contract and earning BAKC token rewards that are pending. The attacker can then call the notional() function to calculate their staking balance, which will not include the pending BAKC token rewards.

By exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker can make it appear as if they have a lower staking balance than they actually do, potentially gaining an unfair advantage in the system.

## Impact
This omission can result in an inaccurate representation of the user's total staking balance, as the pending rewards should also be included in the calculation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, we need to include the pending BAKC token rewards in the calculation of the user's staking balance. One way to do this is to add a new function that calculates the total staking balance including the pending BAKC token rewards, and then modify the notional() function to call this new function.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched:

```solidity
### Patched Code ###

// New function to calculate total staking balance including pending BAKC token rewards
function totalStakingBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 stakingBalance = _notional();
    uint256 pendingRewards = _pendingRewards[msg.sender];
    return stakingBalance + pendingRewards;
}

// Modified notional() function to call totalStakingBalance()
function notional() public view returns (uint256) {
    return totalStakingBalance();
}
```
By adding the **totalStakingBalance()** function to calculate the total staking balance including pending BAKC token rewards, and modifying the **notional()** function to call this new function, we ensure that the user's staking balance is accurately reported.
