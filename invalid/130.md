# Wrong calculation of tokenOutAmount - amountIn when swapping by _swapInSingle and_swapOutSingle

## Summary

Wrong calculation of tokenOutAmount - amountIn when swapping by `UniswapAdapter::_swapInSingle` and `UniswapAdapter::_swapOutSingle` functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

Smilee is always using the `_DEFAULT_FEE` hardcoded to **500** to calculate the **tokenOutAmount** in `UniswapAdapter::_swapInSingle()` and **amountIn** in `UniswapAdapter::_swapOutSingle()`.  
There are several problems with the hardcoding of the 500 as the fee.

- Not all tokens have 500 fee pools
- The swapping takes place in pools that don't have a 500 fee
- The 500 pool fee is not the optimal to fetch the tokenOutAmount/amountIn due to low volume

Specially as they are deploying in so many secondary chains like Kava, this will be a big problem pretty much in every transaction over there.

If any of those scenarios is given, tokenOutAmount/amountIn will be incorrectly calculated and it will return and incorrect amount of tokens swapped.

## Impact

Incorrect tokenOutAmount/amountIn calculation leading to incorrect amount returned, either more or less tokens.
