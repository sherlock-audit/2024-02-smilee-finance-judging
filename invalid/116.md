# The protocol is not checking the status of the L2 sequencer

## Summary
The protocol is not checking the status of the L2 sequencer

## Vulnerability Detail
As a protocol to be deployed on Etheruem L2s, the contracts are not checking the status of the sequencer.

## Impact
If the sequencer is down, the submitted transactions will have to wait for execution, and the data feed to be used maybe also stale, leading to unpredictable states for some state variables of the contract.
