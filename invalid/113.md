# Incorrect Naming Of The ERC721 Contract Name and Symbol Inherited By The PositionManager

## Summary
The name and symbol of the NFT created by the PositionManager are incorrect and out-dated.

## Vulnerability Detail
Strings are passed as arguments to the parameters of the constructor belonging to an ERC721 contract. This contract is inherited by PositionManger constructor. However these strings are out dated, and represent an earlier version of the smilee protocol.

## Impact
A name and symbol that contains the correct information is important for the metadata integrity. This will allow the PositionManager.sol contract to be interrogated for it's name and for details about assets which the NFT's represent. This is also important in maintaining the intregity of the ERC721 Metadata JSON schema.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/periphery/PositionManager.sol#L44

```solidity
constructor() ERC721Enumerable() ERC721("Smilee V0 Trade Positions", "SMIL-V0-TRAD") Ownable() {
    _nextId = 1;
}
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation


Ensure that strings containing up-to-date and relevant information should be passed as arguments to the ERC721 params. 

```solidity
constructor() ERC721Enumerable() ERC721("Smilee V2 Trade Positions", "SMIL-V2-TRAD") Ownable() {
    _nextId = 1;
}
```
