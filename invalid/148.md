# No check for active L2 Sequencer

## Summary

Using Chainlink in L2 chains such as Arbitrum requires to check if the sequencer is down to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not.

The bug could be leveraged by malicious actors to take advantage of the sequencer downtime.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/providers/chainlink/ChainlinkPriceOracle.sol#L117

there is check for stalePrice feed in getTokenPrice()

if (block.timestamp - price.lastUpdate > getPriceFeedMaxDelay(token)) {
            revert PriceTooOld();
        }

But there is not check for Sequencer is down .       
   

## Impact

If the sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow users to continue to operate at the previous (stale) rates and this can be leveraged by malicious actors to gain unfair advantage.
