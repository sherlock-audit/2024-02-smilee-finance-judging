# Deposits can be denied by abusing the maxDeposit function and threshold value

## Summary
A malicious ROLE_ADMIN can reset the maxDeposit value at any point in time, say, to a lower value than the 1_000_000_000 in the constructor, say, due to market volatility conditions. In such instances, a malicious whale can frontruns user deposits with a value that pushes the deposits to the threshold maxDeposit value, thereby denying the deposits of other users.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the setMaxDeposit function in the vault.sol contract, there's no check on the **range** the ROLE_ADMIN can reset the default maxDeposit to: so it could be a lower or higher value. There's also no check as to **when** the ROLE_ADMIN can reset the maxDeposit value.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L187

        function setMaxDeposit(uint256 maxDeposit_) external {
        _checkRole(ROLE_ADMIN);

        maxDeposit = maxDeposit_;
        }

So that means the ROLE_ADMIN can override the default maxDeposit to a lower value, say, 1_000_000 at any preferred instance.
If that becomes the case, the deposits of other users will fail in the check below as  a malicious whale or miners or even users can frontrun other deposits with a value, say, 999_999, making subsequent deposits of other users revert.

`if (amount > maxDeposit - _state.liquidity.totalDeposit) {
            revert ExceedsMaxDeposit();`


## Impact
Users can be blocked from depositing, which in turn, may stop users with priorityAccessFlag from receiving their fair shares of the Vault NFT as  a result. 

Also as  the accumulated deposits of users increase so much in value, the range of amounts later users are allowed to deposit diminishes. This may negatively impact users who would want to deposit a much higher amount to reap higher profits, which may be an inconvenience to them. 

## Code Snippet
Add the below test to the VaultPriorityAccess.t.sol file as a Proof of Concept .  Change the amount parameter of the _provideApprovedTokens_ of the _TokenUtils_ library in the setup function from 1000e18 to 1000000e18.

        function testDepositsRevertDueToMaxDepositThreshold() public {
        vm.startPrank(_admin);
        _vault.setMaxDeposit(1_000_000e18);// ROLE_ADMIN reseting the maxDeposit value.. 
        uint256 tokenIdBob = _nft.createToken(_bob, 999_999e18);
        uint256 tokenIdAlice = _nft.createToken(_alice, 250_000e18);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.prank(_bob);// malicious user or whale pushing the maxDeposit to its threshold
        _vault.deposit(999_900e18, _bob, tokenIdBob);

        vm.prank(_alice);
        vm.expectRevert();
        _vault.deposit(200_000e18, _alice, tokenIdAlice);        

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Require the **ROLE_ADMIN** to only reset the _maxDeposit_ threshold to a value higher than the default one in the constructor. 

the _maxDeposit_ threshold can  be set in proportion to _totalDeposits_ of users. For instance, if the _totalDeposits_ increases to 80% of the capped _maxDeposit_, then the **ROLE_ADMIN** should be able to reset the _maxDeposit_ threshold to at least, say, a 70% higher than the previously capped value. In this case, no matter the deposits of malicious frontrunners, users can never be denied the deposit functionality of the protocol.
