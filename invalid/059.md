# Incorrect Token Accounting in ERC20 Transfer Fee Scenario Leads to Potential Insolvency: in Vault.sol

## Summary
The contract is vulnerable to incorrect token balance tracking due to not accounting for fees on transfer when using an ERC20 token with fee-on-transfer mechanics as **baseToken**.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of this vulnerability in the provided code is that the function **_tokenBalances()** does not account for the transfer fees that may be deducted when tokens are transferred.

In line 279 and 280, the function retrieves the balance of **baseToken** and **sideToken** held by the smart contract. However, if there are transfer fees associated with transferring these tokens, the actual balance available to the smart contract may be less than what is returned by these calls. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect accounting of the available funds in the smart contract, potentially leading to insolvency if the contract relies on these balances for critical operations.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a transfer of tokens that incurs a fee just before calling the **_tokenBalances()** function. This would result in the balances being incorrectly reported, potentially leading to insolvency if the smart contract relies on these balances for important calculations.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) :**

1. Deploy a smart contract that implements the _tokenBalances() function as shown in the original code snippet.
2. Perform a transfer of tokens to the smart contract, ensuring that a transfer fee is deducted.
3. Call the _tokenBalances() function to retrieve the balances of baseToken and sideToken.
4. Compare the balances reported by the function with the actual balances to demonstrate the incorrect accounting due to the transfer fee not being taken into consideration.

By following these steps, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability in the code and demonstrate how it could potentially lead to insolvency in certain scenarios.

## Impact
This mismanagement of funds can lead to protocol insolvency, as the contract may believe it has more tokens than are actually available and can also result in users exploiting the deposit function to receive more collateral tokens than they should. Additionally, the contract may become unable to operate due to a deficit of **baseToken** funds, as withdrawals will provide users with fewer tokens than expected, eventually depleting the contract's token balance."

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code lies in the _tokenBalances() function where it calculates the balance of **baseToken** and **sideToken** held by the contract. In a scenario where a transfer fee is deducted from the token being transferred, the function does not account for this deduction which can lead to incorrect token accounting and potential insolvency.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the **_tokenBalances()** function to take into account the deducted transfer fee when calculating the token balances. This can be achieved by subtracting the transfer fee from the balance of the token being transferred.

Here is the modified code example with the fix:
```solidity
278       function _tokenBalances() internal view returns (uint256 baseTokens, uint256 sideTokens) {
279           baseTokens = IERC20(baseToken).balanceOf(address(this));
280           sideTokens = IERC20(sideToken).balanceOf(address(this));
281           
282           // Adjust for transfer fee deduction if applicable
283           if (transferFee > 0) {
284               baseTokens = baseTokens.sub(transferFee);
285           }
286       }
```
In this updated code, we check if there is a transfer fee applied (represented by the variable **transferFee**) and subtract this fee from the balance of the **baseToken** before returning the balances. This adjustment ensures that the token balances are correctly accounted for, even in scenarios where transfer fees are deducted.
