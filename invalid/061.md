# Cycle Timing Mismatch Leading to Temporary Freezing of User Funds: in Vault.sol

## Summary
A vulnerability exists in the **completeWithdraw** function of the smart contract due to improper handling of withdrawal epochs in conjunction with the update of the 'last token cycle index'. This flaw allows an attacker to initiate a withdrawal at the end of a cycle, causing the system to incorrectly assign subsequent withdrawals to the next cycle. As a result, affected users may experience temporary freezing of funds, as their withdrawals would be delayed until the next cycle. This vulnerability can also be exploited for griefing purposes, where an attacker deliberately causes inconvenience to other users without directly profiting from the action. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of this vulnerability in the code provided is that the withdrawal process is dependent on the current epoch, but the epoch is not updated before the withdrawal is completed.

In line 532, the code checks if at least one epoch has passed since the start of the withdrawal. However, the current epoch is not updated before this check is made. This means that if a user initiates a withdrawal and the epoch changes before the withdrawal is completed, the condition in line 532 will never be met, causing the withdrawal to be permanently stuck in an incomplete state.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the fact that the withdrawal process can be completed before the required epoch has passed, leading to a temporary freezing of user funds.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can initiate a withdrawal request and then quickly call the completeWithdraw function before the required epoch has passed. This will result in the funds being temporarily frozen until the next epoch, as the withdrawal will not be completed successfully.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) :**

1. Attacker initiates a withdrawal request:

```solidity
// Initiate withdrawal request
withdraw();
```
2. Attacker quickly calls the **completeWithdraw** function before the required epoch has passed:
```solidity
// Call completeWithdraw function before required epoch
completeWithdraw();
```
By exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker can temporarily freeze the user funds until the next epoch, causing inconvenience and potential financial loss to the user.
## Impact
The maximum impact of this issue is the disruption of the contract's intended functionality, leading to a failure to deliver promised liquidity in a timely manner, although the contract does not lose value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code is that the withdrawal can be completed before the required epoch has passed, leading to a temporary freezing of user funds. This is because the check on line 532 compares the current epoch with the epoch when the withdrawal was initiated, instead of checking if the required number of epochs have passed.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the condition on line 532 to check if the difference between the current epoch and the epoch when the withdrawal was initiated is greater than or equal to the required number of epochs.

Here is the patched code:
```solidity
523       function completeWithdraw() external whenNotPaused {
524           VaultLib.Withdrawal storage withdrawal = withdrawals[msg.sender];
525   
526           // Checks if there is an initiated withdrawal request
527           if (withdrawal.shares == 0) {
528               revert WithdrawNotInitiated();
529           }
530   
531           // At least one epoch must have passed since the start of the withdrawal
532           if (getEpoch().current - withdrawal.epoch < withdrawal.requiredEpochs) {
533               revert WithdrawTooEarly();
534           }
535   
536           _completeWithdraw();
537       }
```
In this patched code, we are checking if the difference between the current epoch and the epoch when the withdrawal was initiated is greater than or equal to the required number of epochs specified in the withdrawal struct. This ensures that the withdrawal can only be completed after the required number of epochs have passed, preventing the temporary freezing of user funds.
