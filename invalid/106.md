# M-2 : Denial Of Service : Unhandled Chain-link Oracle Price feed absence Revert

## Summary
The protocol should be ready for price-feeds denial of service and prepare the logic for what happens if the price feed data is not fetched correctly. 


On a Side note : Using uni swap as a second oracle sounds good assuming it can not be cheated but with the arrival of PoS
It is far easy to manipulate TWAPS than before so it not a good idea to rely on it as a second oracle in case first serves a denial of service of chainlink feeds :

Read this article why it is so :

## Vulnerability Detail
Calls to [Oracles could potentially revert](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-07-juicebox#m-09-unhandled-chainlink-revert-would-lock-all-price-oracle-access), which may result in a complete Denial-of-Service to smart contracts which depend upon them. Chainlink multisigs can immediately block access to price feeds at will, so just because a price feed is working today does not mean it will continue to do so indefinitely. Smart contracts should handle this by:

- wrapping calls to Oracles in try/catch blocks and dealing appropriately with any errors,
- providing functionality to replace or update Oracle feeds after they are configured.


This would be especially bad for Smilee  where large amounts of user value are stored and users will be affected 
because price data will no longer exist for deleted price feeds and uni swap TWAP is manipulatable.



## Impact
In case price_feeds are deleted from chainlink , and the system tries to get price data from this deleted fee
the entire transaction will fail due to the absence of try/catch block which could have been prevented easily.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use try-catch block to fetch price data, return price data if it is fetched correctly, and add some custom logic in the catch block
