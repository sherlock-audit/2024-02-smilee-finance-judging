# The IG NFT access cap can be exceeded by calling the mint function multiple times

## Summary

The IG Access NFT uses a cap to limit the notional amount a user can mint. This cap can be bypassed by calling the mint function multiple times during an epoch.

## Vulnerability Detail

Here we can see the `_checkNFTAccess` function. It only checks if the user's cap is big enough but does not reduce it after. Therefore the cap is ineffective as the user can call mint with the capped amount multiple times during an epoch:

```solidity
function _checkNFTAccess(uint256 accessTokenId, address receiver, uint256 notionalAmount) internal {
    if (nftAccessFlag) {
        IDVPAccessNFT nft = IDVPAccessNFT(_addressProvider.dvpAccessNFT());
        if (accessTokenId == 0 || nft.ownerOf(accessTokenId) != receiver) {
            revert NFTAccessDenied();
        }
        nft.checkCap(accessTokenId, notionalAmount);
    }
}
```

The following POC can be implemented in the `IGNFTAccess.t.sol` test file:

```solidity
function testExceedNFTCapByMultiMinting() public {
    // bob is allowed to mint a maximum of 100e18 tokens
    vm.prank(_admin);
    uint256 tokenId = _nft.createToken(_bob, 100e18);

    (uint256 expected, ) = _ig.premium(0, 1000e18, 0);

    // bob is not able to mint more than that in one call
    vm.prank(_bob);
    vm.expectRevert(_NFT_ACCESS_CAP_EXCEEDED);
    _ig.mint(_bob, 0, 200e18, 0, expected, 0.1e18, tokenId);

    // but bob is able to mint a arbitrary amount by calling the mint function multiple times
    for (uint256 i=0; i<5; i++) {
        vm.prank(_bob);
        _ig.mint(_bob, 0, 100e18, 0, expected, 0.1e18, tokenId);
    }
}
```

Also, the boolean if users need an NFT to mint is not adjustable in the constructors of the IG and Vault. This enables users to mint between the creation of a new market and the call to make it only available for NFT holders. This could be a potential security risk when trying to create a new market that should be only accessible to NFT holders and could also be used to exceed the cap or bypass the access check completely.

## Impact

Users can exceed the cap set by the admin on their IG Access NFT by calling the mint function multiple times.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Reduce the cap on every mint (as with the vault access NFT) and change the receiver to msg.sender as otherwise, this fix could lead to griefing attacks.
