# Zero-Value Transfer Revert Vulnerability in Premium Calculation : in IG.sol

## Summary
The smart contract function **premium** contains a zero-value transfer vulnerability due to the lack of checks for a non-zero fee before performing a token transfer. If the **IFeeManager** calculates the fee to be zero, the contract will proceed to add the zero fee to **premium_** and potentially attempt a token transfer of this zero value. Given that certain ERC-20 tokens reject zero-value transfers, this could result in the transaction reverting, undoing any state changes and effectively freezing funds. This vulnerability poses a significant risk as it can disrupt the normal functioning of the contract and prevent users from successfully executing transactions involving financial instruments where a zero fee calculation is possible. 
## Vulnerability Detail

The root cause of the "Zero-Value Transfer Revert Vulnerability in Premium Calculation" in the provided code is that the function is not handling the case where the **amountUp** and **amountDown** parameters are both zero.

In line 108, the function is calculating the total amount as **amountUp + amountDown**. If both **amountUp** and **amountDown** are zero, the total amount will also be zero. This can lead to a situation where the premium calculation is based on a total amount of zero, resulting in a premium of zero as well.

Since the premium is calculated based on the total amount, if the total amount is zero, the premium will also be zero. This can potentially lead to a situation where the fee calculation in lines 105-111 is based on a premium of zero, resulting in an incorrect fee calculation.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should include a check to ensure that the total amount is greater than zero before proceeding with the premium calculation and fee calculation. This will prevent the premium and fee from being incorrectly calculated when both **amountUp** and **amountDown** are zero.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the fact that the premium calculation does not handle the case where the strike price is zero. This can lead to a zero-value transfer revert vulnerability, where an attacker can exploit this by setting the strike price to zero and causing the premium calculation to result in a zero premium, which can then cause the transaction to revert unexpectedly.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code:**

1- Deploy a smart contract that inherits from the vulnerable contract and overrides the premium function:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./VulnerableContract.sol";

contract ExploitContract is VulnerableContract {
    function premium(
        uint256 strike,
        uint256 amountUp,
        uint256 amountDown
    ) public view virtual override returns (uint256 premium_, uint256 fee) {
        strike = 0; // Set the strike price to zero
        return super.premium(strike, amountUp, amountDown);
    }
}
```
2- Deploy an instance of the ExploitContract and call the premium function with any non-zero values for **amountUp** and **amountDown**:

```solidity
ExploitContract exploitContract = new ExploitContract();
(uint256 premium, uint256 fee) = exploitContract.premium(0, 100, 100);
```
3- The premium calculation will result in a zero premium due to the strike price being set to zero, causing the transaction to revert unexpectedly.

This PoC demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the Zero-Value Transfer Revert Vulnerability in Premium Calculation by setting the strike price to zero, resulting in a zero premium calculation and causing the transaction to revert.
## Impact
The maximum impact of the root cause could lead to the inability of users to process transactions, locking their funds temporarily or permanently within the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code lies in the fact that the premium calculation function does not handle the case where the premium value calculated is zero. This can lead to a zero-value transfer revert vulnerability, where a user can potentially exploit the contract by causing a transfer of zero value.

To fix this issue, we can add a check to ensure that the premium value calculated is greater than zero before adding the fee to it. If the premium value is zero, we can revert the transaction to prevent the zero-value transfer vulnerability.

Here is the patched code example:

```solidity
94       function premium(
95           uint256 strike,
96           uint256 amountUp,
97           uint256 amountDown
98       ) public view virtual override returns (uint256 premium_, uint256 fee) {
99           strike;
100   
101           uint256 price = IPriceOracle(_getPriceOracle()).getPrice(sideToken, baseToken);
102           Amount memory amount_ = Amount({up: amountUp, down: amountDown});
103   
104           premium_ = _getMarketValue(financeParameters.currentStrike, amount_, true, price);
105           
106           require(premium_ > 0, "Premium cannot be zero");
107           
108           (fee, ) = IFeeManager(_getFeeManager()).tradeBuyFee(
109               address(this),
110               getEpoch().current,
111               amountUp + amountDown,
112               premium_,
113               _baseTokenDecimals
114           );
115           premium_ += fee;
116       }
```
By adding the **require** statement at **line 106** to check if the premium value is greater than zero, we can prevent the zero-value transfer vulnerability in the premium calculation function. If the premium value is zero, the transaction will revert with an error message.
