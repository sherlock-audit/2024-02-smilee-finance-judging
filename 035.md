# Lack of Check in Setter Function in lib/TimeLock.sol

## Summary
In the function with setter logic, there must be a check for msg.sender to ensure that only authorized users can change values. Without this check, unauthorized users might be able to manipulate contract data or execute functions they shouldn't.

## Vulnerability Detail
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could simply call the set function of any of the TimeLocked structs (address, uint, bool, bytes) without proper authorization. This could lead to unauthorized changes in the values stored in the TimeLock structs, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

Proof of Concept (PoC) code:

```solidity
// Attacker contract to exploit the vulnerability
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./TimeLock.sol";

contract Attacker {
    TimeLock.TimeLockedAddress public timeLockedAddress;

    constructor(TimeLock.TimeLockedAddress _timeLockedAddress) {
        timeLockedAddress = _timeLockedAddress;
    }

    function exploit() public {
        // Call the set function without proper authorization
        timeLockedAddress.set(msg.sender, 1000, 3600);
    }
}
```


## Impact
This could lead to unauthorized changes in the values stored in the TimeLock structs, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
This vulnerability occurs because the setter functions do not include any checks to ensure that the delay provided is greater than zero. This could potentially allow an attacker to set a delay of zero, bypassing the intended time lock mechanism.

To fix this issue, we need to add a check in the setter functions to ensure that the delay provided is greater than zero before proceeding with the rest of the function. Below is the corresponding patch code example:

```solidity
33      function set(TimeLockedAddress storage tl, address value, uint256 delay) external {
34          require(delay > 0, "Delay must be greater than zero");
35          if (tl.validFrom == 0) {
36              // The very first call is expected to be safe for immediate usage
37              // NOTE: its security is linked to the deployment script
38              tl.safe = value;
39          }
40          if (tl.validFrom > 0 && block.timestamp >= tl.validFrom) {
41              tl.safe = tl.proposed;
42          }
43          tl.proposed = value;
44          tl.validFrom = block.timestamp + delay;
45      }

58      function set(TimeLockedUInt storage tl, uint256 value, uint256 delay) external {
59          require(delay > 0, "Delay must be greater than zero");
60          if (tl.validFrom == 0) {
61              // The very first call is expected to be safe for immediate usage
62              // NOTE: its security is linked to the deployment script
63              tl.safe = value;
64          }
65          if (tl.validFrom > 0 && block.timestamp >= tl.validFrom) {
66              tl.safe = tl.proposed;
67          }
68          tl.proposed = value;
69          tl.validFrom = block.timestamp + delay;
70      }

83      function set(TimeLockedBool storage tl, bool value, uint256 delay) external {
84          require(delay > 0, "Delay must be greater than zero");
85          if (tl.validFrom == 0) {
86              // The very first call is expected to be safe for immediate usage
87              // NOTE: its security is linked to the deployment script
88              tl.safe = value;
89          }
90          if (tl.validFrom > 0 && block.timestamp >= tl.validFrom) {
91              tl.safe = tl.proposed;
92          }
93          tl.proposed = value;
94          tl.validFrom = block.timestamp + delay;
95      }

108      function set(TimeLockedBytes storage tl, bytes memory value, uint256 delay) external {
109          require(delay > 0, "Delay must be greater than zero");
110          if (tl.validFrom == 0) {
111              // The very first call is expected to be safe for immediate usage
112              // NOTE: its security is linked to the deployment script
113              tl.safe = value;
114          }
115          if (tl.validFrom > 0 && block.timestamp >= tl.validFrom) {
116              tl.safe = tl.proposed;
117          }
118          tl.proposed = value;
119          tl.validFrom = block.timestamp + delay;
120      }
```
By adding the **require(delay > 0, "Delay must be greater than zero")**; check at the beginning of each setter function, we ensure that the delay provided is always greater than zero, preventing the vulnerability from being exploited.
