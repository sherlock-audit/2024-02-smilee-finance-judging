# Potential Inaccurate Swap Price Calculation Due to Yield Vault Withdrawal Limits or Borrowed Fund Constraints: in IG.sol

## Summary
The given code snippet features a vulnerability in the **_deltaHedgePosition** function where it calculates the number of **tokensToSwap** needed for hedging a derivative position and interacts with an external yield vault through **IVault(vault)**.**deltaHedge(-**tokensToSwap**)**. The vulnerability arises if the yield vault has withdrawal limits or operates on borrowed funds, potentially leading to a situation where the vault cannot exchange the expected amount of tokens. This inadequacy may result in an incorrect **swapPrice** calculation by the **Finance.getSwapPrice** function, leading to an incorrect number of tokens being exchanged.
## Vulnerability Detail
Specifically, in lines 201 and 202, the code calculates the available liquidity in the yield vault and the amount of side tokens held in the vault. However, it does not consider the scenario where the yield vault may have withdrawal limits or borrowed fund constraints that could affect the actual amount of tokens available for swapping.

As a result, the calculation of **tokensToSwap** in lines 204 to 214 may not accurately reflect the true amount of tokens that can be swapped, leading to potential inaccuracies in the swap price calculation in lines 223 and 224. This can result in incorrect hedging decisions and potentially expose the protocol to financial risks.

The vulnerability in the provided code arises from the potential inaccurate swap price calculation due to yield vault withdrawal limits or borrowed fund constraints. This vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the available liquidity and side token balances in such a way that the calculation of tokens to swap in the **_deltaHedgePosition** function becomes inaccurate.

Proof of Concept (PoC) :

1. Deploy a malicious smart contract that interacts with the vulnerable contract containing the **_deltaHedgePosition** function.
2. Manipulate the available liquidity and side token balances in the yield vault to create a scenario where the calculation of tokens to swap in the **_deltaHedgePosition** function is inaccurate.
3. Call the _deltaHedgePosition function with manipulated parameters to trigger the inaccurate swap price calculation.
4. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially manipulate the swap price calculation in their favor, leading to financial gains or losses depending on the direction of the manipulation.

It is important for the developers to review and update the code to ensure accurate swap price calculations and prevent potential exploits due to inaccurate calculations.
## Impact
The impact could be severe for users if they receive fewer tokens than entitled when withdrawing funds, which may lead to protocol insolvency or a failure to deliver promised returns.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code arises from the fact that the calculation of the swap price in the _deltaHedgePosition function does not take into account potential withdrawal limits or borrowed fund constraints of the yield vault. This can lead to inaccurate swap price calculations and potentially result in financial losses.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the calculation of the swap price considers the actual amount of tokens that can be swapped in the yield vault, taking into account any withdrawal limits or borrowed fund constraints. One way to address this is to modify the calculation of **exchangedBaseTokens** in line 221 to reflect the actual amount that can be swapped in the vault.

Here is an example of a patch code to address the vulnerability:

```solidity
221           uint256 maxTokensToSwap = IVault(vault).maxTokensToSwap();
222           uint256 actualTokensToSwap = tokensToSwap > maxTokensToSwap ? maxTokensToSwap : tokensToSwap;
223           uint256 exchangedBaseTokens = IVault(vault).deltaHedge(-actualTokensToSwap);
```
In this patch code, we first retrieve the maximum amount of tokens that can be swapped in the vault using the **maxTokensToSwap** function. We then compare this value with the calculated **tokensToSwap** and use the minimum of the two as the **actualTokensToSwap** to ensure that we do not exceed the limits of the vault. Finally, we use the **actualTokensToSwap** in the **deltaHedge** function to accurately calculate the swap price based on the actual amount that can be swapped in the vault.
