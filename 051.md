# Inaccurate Principal Calculation Due to Non-Zero Start Fees Leading to Potential Liquidity Shortage: in Vault.sol

## Summary
The code contains a vulnerability where the **_notionalBaseTokens** function may incorrectly calculate the available amount of base tokens due to the improper handling of pending transactions (sum of **pendingWithdrawals**, **pendingDeposits**, and **pendingPayoffs**). This flaw could be exploited by artificially inflating the **pendings**, leading to a potential underflow or revert due to perceived insufficient liquidity.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of this vulnerability in the provided code is that the function **_notionalBaseTokens()** calculates the available base tokens by subtracting the total pending withdrawals, deposits, and payoffs from the total base tokens. However, it does not take into account the start fees that may have been collected.

Since the start fees are not considered in the calculation, the available base tokens may be inaccurately calculated, leading to potential liquidity shortage. This can result in the smart contract not having enough liquidity to cover all pending withdrawals, deposits, and payoffs, which can cause unexpected behavior or even loss of funds.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code:**

1. Assume that the total base tokens are 1000.
2. Assume that there are pending withdrawals of 200, pending deposits of 300, pending payoffs of 100, and a non-zero start fee of 50.
3. According to the current code, the calculation would be: Total pending = 200 + 300 + 100 = 600 Available liquidity = 1000 - 600 = 400
4. However, with the non-zero start fee, the accurate calculation should be: Total pending = 200 + 300 + 100 + 50 = 650 Available liquidity = 1000 - 650 = 350
5. By exploiting this discrepancy, an attacker could withdraw more funds than actually available, leading to a liquidity shortage.

This PoC demonstrates how the inaccurate principal calculation due to non-zero start fees can be exploited to potentially cause a liquidity shortage in the smart contract.
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability could result in the freezing of user funds, protocol insolvency, or the inability of the smart contract to operate, as legitimate operations might be blocked by the inflated pending amounts, which do not represent the true state of liquidity within the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, we need to adjust the calculation of notional base tokens to include the start fees deducted from the base tokens. We can do this by subtracting the start fees from the base tokens before subtracting the pendings on line 267.

Here is the patched code example:

```solidity
255       function _notionalBaseTokens() internal view returns (uint256 amount_) {
256           (uint256 baseTokens, ) = _tokenBalances();
257   
258           uint256 pendings = _state.liquidity.pendingWithdrawals +
259               _state.liquidity.pendingDeposits +
260               _state.liquidity.pendingPayoffs;
261   
262           // Just catching the underflow and reverting with a more explicit error (see [IL-NOTE])
263           if (baseTokens < pendings) {
264               revert InsufficientLiquidity(bytes4(keccak256("_notionalBaseTokens()")));
265           }
266   
267           uint256 availableBaseTokens = baseTokens - _state.liquidity.startFees - pendings;
268   
269           return availableBaseTokens;
270       }
```
In this patched code, we subtract the start fees from the base tokens before subtracting the pendings to calculate the available base tokens accurately. This adjustment ensures that the notional base tokens calculation considers all relevant factors, preventing potential liquidity shortages due to inaccurate principal calculation.
