# DoS on IG's mint and burn through FeeManager.trackVaultFee

## Summary

The FeeManager's `trackVaultFee` function acts as a counter for tracking fees in an ever-increasing manner:

```Solidity
File: FeeManager.sol
217:     /// @inheritdoc IFeeManager
218:     function trackVaultFee(address vault, uint256 feeAmount) external {
219:         // Check sender:
220:         IDVP dvp = IDVP(msg.sender);
221:         if (vault != dvp.vault()) {
222:             revert WrongVault();
223:         }
224: 
225:         vaultFeeAmounts[vault] += feeAmount;
226: 
227:         emit TransferVaultFee(vault, feeAmount);
228:     }
```

This function misses authentication of `msg.sender`. 

## Vulnerability Detail

We can imagine a situation where `msg.sender` is a malicious contract that exposes a `vault()` function returning the address of an actual vault; this actor can then increase the `vaultFeeAmounts[vault]` counter by an arbitrary amount. If the counter is raised to `type(uint256).max`, then all subsequent calls to  `trackVaultFee` with non-zero amounts will revert by overflow.

## Impact

Since `trackVaultFee` is called by DVP (and consequently IG) contracts every time tokens are minted or burnt, these mint and burn actions will always revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Consider adding a `Registry.isRegistered(msg.sender)` check to verify that `msg.sender` is a valid DVP 
- Alternatively, instead of checking if the provided vault is the sender's vault, it would be safer to check if `msg.sender` is the provided vault's DVP via a call to the Vaut's `address public dvp` getter
