# Insufficient access control in FeeManager leads to DOS

## Summary
Attacker can set vault fee to maximum value, so that vault can't accrue additional fee. This bahaviour will block all minting and burning in Vault because fee is accrued on every operation

## Vulnerability Detail
Attacker can deploy contract that calls `FeeManager.trackVaultFee()` and sets `vaultFeeAmount` of certain vault to `uint256.max`.
It is possible because `vault()` is called on msg.sender, who can be malicious.
```solidity
    function trackVaultFee(address vault, uint256 feeAmount) external {
        // Check sender:
        IDVP dvp = IDVP(msg.sender);
        if (vault != dvp.vault()) {
            revert WrongVault();
        }

        vaultFeeAmounts[vault] += feeAmount;

        emit TransferVaultFee(vault, feeAmount);
    }
```

## Impact
Attacker can make calls to `trackVaultFee` revert setting `vaultFeeAmounts[vault] = type(uint256).max`. As a result, calls to `mint()` and `burn()` will revert in Vault:
```solidity
    function _mint(
        address recipient,
        uint256 strike,
        Amount memory amount,
        uint256 expectedPremium,
        uint256 maxSlippage
    ) internal returns (uint256 premium_) {
        ...
        feeManager.trackVaultFee(address(vault), vaultFee);
        ...
    }

    function _burn(
        uint256 expiry,
        address recipient,
        uint256 strike,
        Amount memory amount,
        uint256 expectedMarketValue,
        uint256 maxSlippage
    ) internal returns (uint256 paidPayoff) {
        ...
        feeManager.trackVaultFee(address(vault), vaultFee);

        emit Burn(msg.sender);
    }
```

As a result, users can't redeem underlying tokens.
