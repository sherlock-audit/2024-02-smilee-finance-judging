# Malicious DVP can cause dos attack in FeeManager

## Summary
Malicious hacker can interact with FeeManager contract as one DVP to update vault's vault fee, which could cause Dos.

## Vulnerability Detail
Traders will trade by mint/burn one position. No matter buy or sell, some vault fees will be generated and record this into feeManager contract.
```solidity
    function _mint(
        address recipient,
        uint256 strike,
        Amount memory amount,
        uint256 expectedPremium,
        uint256 maxSlippage
    ) internal returns (uint256 premium_) {
        _checkEpochNotFinished();
        _requireNotPaused();
       ...

        // Get base premium from sender:
        IERC20Metadata(baseToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, vault, premium_ + vaultFee);
        feeManager.trackVaultFee(address(vault), vaultFee);
        ...
    }
    function _burn(
        uint256 expiry,
        address recipient,
        uint256 strike,
        Amount memory amount,
        uint256 expectedMarketValue,
        uint256 maxSlippage
    ) internal returns (uint256 paidPayoff) {
        _requireNotPaused();
        Position.Info storage position = _getPosition(expiry, msg.sender, strike);
        ...
        IERC20Metadata(baseToken).safeApprove(address(feeManager), netFee);
        feeManager.receiveFee(netFee);
        feeManager.trackVaultFee(address(vault), vaultFee);
    }

```

Vault fees recorded in FeeManger can be manipulated. Assume actual dvp address is dvpAddr, and vault addr is vaultAddr. Hacker can deploy one malicious contract called malicious dvp, it's address is maliciousDvpAddr. In malicious dvp contract, we set related vault state to **vaultAddr**. By this way, we can pass check in trackVaultFee(). We can use malicious dvp contract to update trackVaultFee to one very large value, eg max(uint256). 

```solidity
    function trackVaultFee(address vault, uint256 feeAmount) external {
        // Check sender:
        IDVP dvp = IDVP(msg.sender);
        if (vault != dvp.vault()) {
            revert WrongVault();
        }
        vaultFeeAmounts[vault] += feeAmount;

        emit TransferVaultFee(vault, feeAmount);
    }

```

After vault fee amount manipulation, when traders want to buy or sell position, track vault fee operation will revert because of overflow.

## Impact
Traders cannot trade in this dvp.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In FeeManager contract, add one dvp whitelist. Only allowed dvp contract can update trackVaultFee().
