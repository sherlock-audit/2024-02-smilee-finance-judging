# Unsafe usage of safeApprove

## Summary
Openzeppelin's `SafeERC20::safeApprove` reverts on certain tokens when a non-zero approval is changed to a non-zero approval. In all instances where `safeApprove` is used, it is not reset to 0 first, therefore it will revert, causing denial of service to certain functionalities of the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol explicitly states that `Smilee can work with any ERC20 tokens.`

There are multiple instances throughout the in-scope contracts where there is unsafe usage of `safeApprove`. As stated in the summary, `SafeERC20::safeApprove` reverts on some tokens (such as USDT) when a non-zero approval is changed to a non-zero approval. In all instances where `safeApprove` is used, it is not reset to 0 first, therefore it will revert.

## Impact
If `safeApprove` was already used on a user's tokens, they will not be able to use the functionalities that call `safeApprove` on the user's tokens again, since it will revert.

## Code Snippet
`Vault::_sellSideTokens` [#L797-814](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L812)
```javascript
    function _sellSideTokens(uint256 amount) internal returns (uint256 baseTokens) {
        if (amount == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        (, uint256 sideTokens) = _tokenBalances();
        if (amount > sideTokens) {
            revert InsufficientLiquidity(bytes4(keccak256("_sellSideTokens()")));
        }

        address exchangeAddress = _addressProvider.exchangeAdapter();
        if (exchangeAddress == address(0)) {
            revert AddressZero();
        }
        IExchange exchange = IExchange(exchangeAddress);

@>  IERC20(sideToken).safeApprove(exchangeAddress, amount);
        baseTokens = exchange.swapIn(sideToken, baseToken, amount);
    }
```

Since there are many instances throughout the in-scope contracts where it is used, I will not include a snippet for each one. But I will name the contracts which should be looked at for this issue.

`Vault.sol`, `UniswapAdapter.sol`, `SwapAdapterRouter.sol`,  `DVP.sol`, `FeeManager.sol`, `UniswapAdapter.sol`.

## Recommendation
Consider using `safeIncreaseAllowance` and `safeDecreaseAllowance` instead of `safeApprove`
