# Partial Closing Bypasses Maximum Profit Limit in Payoff Calculation: in DVP.sol

## Summary
The **payoff** function in the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a potential exploitation where users can bypass the maximum profit percentage limit (**maxWinPercent**) through partial closing of their positions. The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the absence of any explicit checks or enforcement of the **maxWinPercent** limit for partial position closures within the function. This could allow users to claim profits that exceed the intended limits, undermining the contract's economic constraints and potentially leading to protocol insolvency.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of this vulnerability in the provided code is that the payoff function allows users to partially close their position before maturity, which can bypass the maximum profit limit set for the position.

In lines 436 to 460, the function calculates the payoff for a position based on the amount of tokens the user wants to close. However, the calculation does not take into account the maximum profit limit that should be enforced for the position. This means that a user can partially close their position, potentially exceeding the maximum profit limit set for the position.

The vulnerability in the provided code is that the payoff calculation does not take into account the maximum profit limit when partially closing a position. This means that a user could potentially bypass the maximum profit limit by partially closing their position.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) :**

1. Assume that the maximum profit limit for a position is set at 1000 tokens.
2. Create a position with an expiry, strike, and amountUp of 1000 tokens each.
3. Call the payoff function with amountDown as 500 tokens.
4. The payoff calculation will not consider the maximum profit limit and will return a payoff of 1000 tokens.
5. The fee calculation will be based on the total amount of tokens (1000 + 500 = 1500 tokens).
6. If the fee is less than the payoff (which it will be in this case), the payoff will be reduced by the fee.
7. The user will end up with a payoff of 1000 tokens, bypassing the maximum profit limit of 1000 tokens.

This PoC demonstrates how a user could exploit the vulnerability in the code to bypass the maximum profit limit by partially closing their position.

## Impact
The maximum achievable impact of this root cause is that users may extract an unfairly large amount of funds, which could deplete the liquidity pool and negatively affect other participants in the ecosystem.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This vulnerability occurs because the payoff function allows users to partially close their position, which can bypass the maximum profit limit set for the position. This can lead to unexpected outcomes and potential loss for the contract.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the user can only close the entire position at once, rather than partially. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that the sum of **amountUp** and **amountDown** passed to the **payoff** function is equal to the total amount of the position. If it is not equal, the function should revert.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to prevent partial closing:
```solidity
421       function payoff(
422           uint256 expiry,
423           uint256 strike,
424           uint256 amountUp,
425           uint256 amountDown
426       ) public view virtual returns (uint256 payoff_, uint256 fee_) {
427           Position.Info storage position = _getPosition(expiry, msg.sender, strike);
428           if (!position.exists()) {
429               revert PositionNotFound();
430           }
431   
432           Amount memory amount_ = Amount({up: amountUp, down: amountDown});
433           bool expired = position.epoch != getEpoch().current;
434   
435           require(amount_.up + amount_.down == position.amount.up + position.amount.down, "Partial closing not allowed");
436   
437           if (!expired) {
438               // The user wants to know how much is her position worth before reaching maturity
439               uint256 price = IPriceOracle(_getPriceOracle()).getPrice(sideToken, baseToken);
440               payoff_ = _getMarketValue(strike, amount_, false, price);
441           } else {
442               // The position expired, the user must close the entire position
443   
444               // The position is eligible for a share of the <epoch, strike, strategy> payoff set aside at epoch end:
445   
446               Amount memory payoffAmount_ = _liquidity[position.epoch].shareOfPayoff(
447                   position.strike,
448                   amount_,
449                   _baseTokenDecimals
450               );
451               payoff_ = payoffAmount_.getTotal();
452           }
453   
454           IFeeManager feeManager = IFeeManager(_getFeeManager());
455           (fee_, ) = feeManager.tradeSellFee(
456               address(this),
457               expiry,
458               amount_.up + amount_.down,
459               payoff_,
460               position.premium,
461               _baseTokenDecimals
462           );
463   
464           if (payoff_ >= fee_) {
465               payoff_ -= fee_;
466           } else {
467               fee_ = payoff_;
468               payoff_ = 0;
469           }
470       }
```
By adding the **require** statement at line 435, we ensure that the user can only close the entire position at once, preventing the vulnerability of partial closing bypassing the maximum profit limit in the payoff calculation.
