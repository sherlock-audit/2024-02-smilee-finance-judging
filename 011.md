# Missing output check in `_sellSideTokens` swap in Vault `_adjustBalances` allows starting insolvent epochs

## Summary

When the Vault rolls a new epoch, its `_adjustBalances` function ensures that the new epoch is solvent in base tokens. This constraint may however not be respected in case `_sellSideTokens` swaps at a slightly worse price than what the price oracle returned, and there are not enough `halfOfRemainingSideTokens` to offset this price difference.

## Vulnerability Detail

If we look at the `_adjustBalances()` function in the Vault, we see that, to make sure the new epoch is solvent, this function sells (L711) an amount of side tokens equal to what's needed to cover the gap (L693), assuming the swap price is the oracle price (L698), plus a few more tokens used as margin (L710). 

```Solidity
File: Vault.sol
685:     function _adjustBalances() internal {
---
692:         (uint256 baseTokens, uint256 sideTokens) = _tokenBalances();
693:         uint256 pendings = _state.liquidity.pendingWithdrawals + _state.liquidity.pendingPayoffs;
694: 
695:         if (baseTokens < pendings) {
696:             // We must cover the missing base tokens by selling an amount of side tokens:
697:             uint256 missingBaseTokens = pendings - baseTokens;
698:             uint256 sideTokensForMissingBaseTokens = exchange.getInputAmount(sideToken, baseToken, missingBaseTokens);
699: 
700:             // see [IL-NOTE]
701:             if (sideTokensForMissingBaseTokens > sideTokens) {
702:                 revert InsufficientLiquidity(
703:                     bytes4(keccak256("_adjustBalances():sideTokensForMissingBaseTokens > sideTokens"))
704:                 );
705:             }
706: 
707:             // Once we covered the missing base tokens, we still have to reach an equal weight portfolio
708:             // with residual liquidity, so we also have to sell half of the remaining side tokens
709:             uint256 halfOfRemainingSideTokens = (sideTokens - sideTokensForMissingBaseTokens) / 2;
710:             uint256 sideTokensToSell = sideTokensForMissingBaseTokens + halfOfRemainingSideTokens;
711:             _sellSideTokens(sideTokensToSell);
712:         } else {
```

If we imagine the case where the margin tokens (`halfOfRemainingSideTokens` L709) are very few or zero, we see that the swap at L711, which operates with a small but non-zero slippage vs the oracle price, can end up buying less than `missingBaseTokens`.

When this happens, the new epoch will be insolvent.

## Impact

This issue allows for the opening of an insolvent epoch, where not all tokens can be withdrawn due to the Vault not having enough balance to cover the withdrawals and payoffs that become due in the epoch.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding an extra check to make sure the swap slippage did not lead to an insolvent epoch:

```diff
             uint256 halfOfRemainingSideTokens = (sideTokens - sideTokensForMissingBaseTokens) / 2;
             uint256 sideTokensToSell = sideTokensForMissingBaseTokens + halfOfRemainingSideTokens;
-            _sellSideTokens(sideTokensToSell);
+            uint256 boughtTokens = _sellSideTokens(sideTokensToSell);
+            require(boughtTokens >= missingBaseTokens);
```
