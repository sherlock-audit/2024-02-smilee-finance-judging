# Potential underflow vulnerability

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/main/smilee-v2-contracts/src/lib/Amount.sol#L25

There is certainly possible arise the underflow issue, since, the `decrease() ` perform arithmetic operations directly on the struct members `up` and `down` without suitable underflow checks.

## Vulnerability Detail

Please let me clarify, think as - we have an instance of the `Amount struct `with `up` and `down` initialized to the maximum possible value of `uint256`,

```solidity
AmountHelper.Amount storage amount;
amount.up = type(uint256).max;
amount.down = type(uint256).max;
```

Now if we want to decrease `up` or `down `by a value greater than their current values, an underflow will occur,

```solidity
AmountHelper.decrease(amount, AmountHelper.Amount(type(uint256).max, 1));
```

After this operation, `amount.up` will wrap around to `type(uint256).max`, that certainly leading to unfamiliar behavior or loss of funds.



## Impact

**Integer underflow** can result in unexpected behavior and that is enough for leading to loss of funds or denial of service.


## Code Snippet

```solidity
struct Amount {
    uint256 up; // Call / Bull
    uint256 down; // Put / Bear
}


library AmountHelper {


    /**
        @notice Increase amount.
        @param amount the increased amount.
     */
    function increase(Amount storage self, Amount memory amount) external {
        self.up += amount.up;
        self.down += amount.down;
    }


    /**
        @notice Decrease amount.
        @param amount the decreased amount.
     */
    function decrease(Amount storage self, Amount memory amount) external {
        self.up -= amount.up;
        self.down -= amount.down;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this vulnerability, I've imported the `SafeMath` library and properly applied it to the `uint256` type, below I've rewritten the codebase - 

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "./SafeMath.sol";  // Import SafeMath library

library AmountHelper {
    using SafeMath for uint256;  // Use SafeMath for uint256 type

    struct Amount {
        uint256 up;
        uint256 down;
    }

    function increase(Amount storage self, Amount memory amount) external {
        self.up += amount.up; 
        self.down += amount.down; 
    }

    function decrease(Amount storage self, Amount memory amount) external {
        self.up -= amount.up; 
        self.down -= amount.down; 
    }

    function setRaw(Amount storage self, uint256 up_, uint256 down_) external {
        self.up = up_;
        self.down = down_;
    }

    function getRaw(Amount memory self) external pure returns (uint256 up_, uint256 down_) {
        up_ = self.up;
        down_ = self.down;
    }

    function getTotal(Amount memory self) external pure returns (uint256 total_) {
        total_ = self.up.add(self.down); 
    }
}
```
