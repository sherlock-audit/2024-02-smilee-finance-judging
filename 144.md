# _DEFAULT_FEE is set to worng basis points

## Summary
The constant _DEFAULT_FEE in the codebase is currently set to 500, which contradicts the accompanying comment indicating a fee of 0.05% (hundredths of basis points). This inconsistency could lead to misunderstanding and potential errors in fee calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The discrepancy lies in the interpretation of the _DEFAULT_FEE constant. While the comment suggests a fee of 0.05%, the value assigned (500) equates to 5%. This inconsistency could mislead developers and users regarding the actual fee applied during swaps.

## Impact
As a result of the incorrect fee calculation, the pool might unintentionally charge a higher fee of 5% instead of the intended 0.05%, potentially impacting users' trading experience and trust in the system.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    uint24 constant _DEFAULT_FEE = 500; // 0.05% (hundredths of basis points)
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
- uint24 constant _DEFAULT_FEE = 500; // 0.05% (hundredths of basis points)
+ uint24 constant _DEFAULT_FEE = 5; // 0.05% (hundredths of basis points)
```
Adjusting the value of _DEFAULT_FEE to 5 aligns with the intended fee rate of 0.05%, ensuring consistency between the code and the accompanying comment. This correction will accurately reflect the fee structure and prevent potential misunderstandings.
