# Potential Price Manipulation Vulnerability in DeFi Oracle Price Fetching: in providers/SwapAdapterRouter.sol

## Summary
The **_valueIn** function within the smart contract is vulnerable to a Price Manipulation Vulnerability due to its reliance on a potentially manipulable oracle price feed (**IPriceOracle**). The function computes the input value of a token (**amountIn**) based on the price of one token relative to another (**tokenOut** in terms of **tokenIn**) provided by the oracle. If the oracle's price data can be tampered with, for example, by exploiting an immediate price function from an Automated Market Maker (AMM) without time-weighted average price (TWAP) protections, an attacker could artificially skew the price. This manipulation would result in an erroneous **amountIn** calculation, potentially leading to severe financial consequences such as under-collateralization, incorrect swap amounts, or other financial discrepancies within the DeFi protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the "Potential Price Manipulation Vulnerability in DeFi Oracle Price Fetching" in the provided code is on line 256.

In this line, the price fetched from the oracle (variable price) is multiplied by the **amountOut** without any validation or sanity check on the value of price. This means that if an attacker can manipulate the price returned by the oracle, they can potentially manipulate the **amountIn** value calculated in this function.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) :**

1. Deploy a malicious smart contract that implements the **IPriceOracle** interface and provides false price data for specific token pairs.
2. Call the **_valueIn** function in the vulnerable smart contract with the malicious smart contract address as the price oracle.
3. Provide false price data for a token pair that results in a significant difference in the calculated **amountIn** value.

By manipulating the price data, the attacker can potentially profit from arbitrage opportunities or cause losses to other users relying on the price information fetched from the oracle.

This PoC demonstrates how an attacker could exploit the potential price manipulation vulnerability in the DeFi oracle price fetching mechanism of the smart contract.
## Impact
By not validating or verifying the price fetched from the oracle, the smart contract is vulnerable to price manipulation attacks where an attacker can provide a false price to the contract, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially exploiting the system. So the maximum achievable impact could range from loss of funds, protocol insolvency, to exploitation of other dependent financial mechanisms within the ecosystem, posing a high severity risk.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code lies in the potential price manipulation when fetching prices from the DeFi oracle. The price fetched from the oracle on **line 253** is used directly in the calculation without any validation or verification. This can lead to an attacker manipulating the price in the oracle to exploit the system.

To fix this issue, we can add a check to ensure that the price fetched from the oracle is within an acceptable range or threshold. If the price deviates significantly from the expected range, the function should revert to prevent any potential manipulation.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to include this check:

```solidity
251       function _valueIn(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amountOut) private view returns (uint256 amountIn) {
252           IPriceOracle po = IPriceOracle(_ap.priceOracle());
253           uint256 price = po.getPrice(tokenOut, tokenIn);
254           require(price > 0, "Price not available");
255           require(price < MAX_PRICE, "Price exceeds maximum threshold");
256           uint8 dIn = IERC20Metadata(tokenIn).decimals();
257           uint8 dOut = IERC20Metadata(tokenOut).decimals();
258           amountIn = price * amountOut;
259           amountIn = dIn > dOut ? amountIn * 10 ** (dIn - dOut) : amountIn / 10 ** (dOut - dIn);
260           amountIn = amountIn / 10 ** 18;
261       }
```
In this patched code, we added two **require** statements on lines **254** and **255** to check if the price fetched is greater than 0 and within a maximum threshold **MAX_PRICE**. If the conditions are not met, the function will revert, preventing any potential price manipulation vulnerability in the DeFi oracle price fetching.
