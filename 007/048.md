# Incorrect Token Conversion Calculation Due to Unnormalized Oracle Price: in /providers/SwapAdapterRouter.sol

## Summary
The **_valueOut** function in the provided code contains a vulnerability due to the incorrect assumption that the price returned by the price oracle is normalized to 18 decimals. This flaw originates from the lack of validation or adjustment for the oracle price's decimal precision before performing calculations to determine the **amountOut**. The function multiplies the non-normalized oracle price with the **amountIn**, adjusts for the token decimal differences, and then divides by **10 ** 18**, potentially leading to a substantial miscalculation of **amountOut**. 
## Vulnerability Detail
This vulnerability in the provided code is that the price obtained from the oracle (**line 236**) is not normalized based on the decimals of the tokens involved before performing the multiplication or division operations.

In **line 239**, the price obtained from the oracle is directly multiplied by the input amount without considering the decimal difference between the tokens. Similarly, in **line 240**, the code attempts to adjust the amount based on the decimal difference between the tokens, but this adjustment is not correctly applied due to the lack of normalization of the price.

As a result, the final **amountOut** calculated in **line 241** is not accurate and may lead to incorrect token conversion calculations. To address this vulnerability, the price obtained from the oracle should be normalized based on the decimals of the tokens before performing any arithmetic operations.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the calculation of the **amountOut** in the **_valueOut** function. The issue is that the price retrieved from the oracle is not normalized to the same decimal scale as the tokens being converted, leading to incorrect conversion calculations.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could create a scenario where the price retrieved from the oracle is not normalized to the same decimal scale as the tokens being converted. By manipulating the price and the decimal scales of the tokens involved, the attacker could potentially gain more tokens than they should in the conversion process.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code:**

1. Attacker deploys a malicious token contract with a decimal scale of 6.
2. Attacker calls the **_valueOut** function with **tokenIn** as the malicious token contract address, **tokenOut** as a legitimate token address with a decimal scale of 18, and a certain **amountIn**.
3. Attacker manipulates the price returned by the oracle to be unnormalized, for example, setting the price to 1 instead of 0.000001.
4. The **_valueOut** function calculates the **amountOut** incorrectly due to the unnormalized price and decimal scales, resulting in the attacker receiving more tokens than expected.

By exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker could potentially manipulate token conversions to gain more tokens than they should, leading to financial losses for the smart contract users.

## Impact
If exploited, this could result in significant financial losses, including but not limited to incorrect token exchanges, miner-extractable value (MEV) opportunities, protocol insolvency, and unfulfilled contract obligations. The maximum impact of the vulnerability could lead to severe financial damage to the protocol and its users, necessitating immediate remediation to validate or correctly adjust the oracle price within the calculation to reflect its actual precision.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code lies in line 239 where the price is multiplied by the input amount without taking into account the decimal difference between the two tokens. This can lead to incorrect token conversion calculations due to unnormalized oracle price.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the calculation of the amountOut based on the decimal difference between the two tokens. We should normalize the price by adjusting it according to the decimal difference before performing the multiplication.

Here is the patched code example:

```solidity
234       function _valueOut(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amountIn) private view returns (uint256 amountOut) {
235           IPriceOracle po = IPriceOracle(_ap.priceOracle());
236           uint256 price = po.getPrice(tokenIn, tokenOut);
237           uint8 dIn = IERC20Metadata(tokenIn).decimals();
238           uint8 dOut = IERC20Metadata(tokenOut).decimals();
239           uint256 normalizedPrice = price * 10 ** (uint256(dOut) - uint256(dIn));
240           amountOut = normalizedPrice * amountIn / 10 ** 18;
241       }
```
In this patched code, we first calculate the normalized price by adjusting it based on the decimal difference between the two tokens. Then, we multiply the normalized price by the input amount and divide by 10^18 to get the correct **amountOut** value. This ensures that the token conversion calculation is done correctly taking into account the decimal difference between the tokens.
