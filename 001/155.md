# Missing checks for whether L2 Sequencer is active

## Summary

Using Chainlink in L2 chains such as Arbitrum requires to check if the sequencer is down to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not according to their [recommendation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#arbitrum)

## Vulnerability Detail
No check for oracle is down .

In another function where it is used there stale price feed is check but not for sequencer is down
## Impact

If the sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow users to continue to operate at the previous (stale) rates and this can be leveraged by malicious actors to gain unfair advantage.
