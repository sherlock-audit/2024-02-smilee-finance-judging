# M-1 : No check if Arbitrum L2 sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
Smilee is intended to be deployed on Arbitrum.
Using Chainlink in L2 chains such as Arbitrum requires checking if the sequencer is down to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not.
The bug could be leveraged by malicious actors to take advantage of the sequencer downtime.

Note :-  Previous audit report just flagged `updatedAt` field for oracle price and not this issue.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_getFeedValue` gets the price of the token from the chainlink price feed but it does not check if the Arbitrum sequencer is down:

```solidity
    function _getFeedValue(address priceFeedAddr) internal view returns (OracleValue memory datum) {
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(priceFeedAddr);
        /*
            latestRoundData SHOULD raise "No data present"
            if they do not have data to report, instead of returning unset values
            which could be misinterpreted as actual reported values.
        */
        (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        if (answer < 0) {
            revert PriceNegative();
        }

        datum.value = AmountsMath.wrapDecimals(uint256(answer), priceFeed.decimals());
        datum.lastUpdate = updatedAt;
    }
```

## Impact
The impact depends on the use-case.

Right now protocol team has suggested that they are doing less stuff with pricing for now but in the future due to potential 
uses of prices can cause arbitrary issues among which loss of user funds is suspected.
So , to avoid future potential cases of funds loss , this issue should be mitigated.
