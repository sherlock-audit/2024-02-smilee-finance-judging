# Missing check if Arbitrum L2 sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary

Using Chainlink in L2 chains such as Arbitrum requires to check if the sequencer is down to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not. This bug could be leveraged by malicious actors to take advantage of the sequencer downtime.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `getTokenPrice` function in `ChainlinkPriceOracle` contract does check for stale prices, but not if the sequencer is down:

```solidity
function getTokenPrice(address token) public view returns (uint256) {
    if (token == address(0)) {
        revert AddressZero();
    }

    address priceFeed = feeds[token].get();
    if (priceFeed == address(0)) {
        revert TokenNotSupported();
    }

    OracleValue memory price = _getFeedValue(priceFeed);

    // Protect against stale feeds:
    if (block.timestamp - price.lastUpdate > getPriceFeedMaxDelay(token)) {
        revert PriceTooOld();
    }

    return price.value;
}
```

This means that if the sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow users to continue to operate at the previous (stale) rates.

Also, the check if the `answer` is smaller than zero in the `_getFeedValue` function should be changed to smaller or equal to zero. A zero value could also indicate that something with the price feed is wrong:

```solidity
function _getFeedValue(address priceFeedAddr) internal view returns (OracleValue memory datum) {
    ...
    (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

    if (answer < 0) {
        revert PriceNegative();
    }

    ...
}
```

## Impact

If the sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow users to continue to operate at the previous (stale) rates and this can be leveraged by malicious actors to gain unfair advantage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to follow the code example of Chainlink: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code

Also, change the showcased `answer < 0` check to `answer <= 0` in the `_getFeedValue` function.
