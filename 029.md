# Incorrect fee calculation when selling/burning a DVP position

## Summary
The wrong parameter is passed into `FeeManager::tradeSellFee()` and this leads to incorrect fee calculation within `DVP::_burn()`

## Vulnerability Detail
In [`DVP::_burn()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-smilee-finance/blob/3241f1bf0c8e951a41dd2e51997f64ef3ec017bd/smilee-v2-contracts/src/DVP.sol#L290-L297), the fee is calculated in the following way:

```solidity
(uint256 fee, uint256 vaultFee) = feeManager.tradeSellFee(
        address(this),
        expiry,
        amount.up + amount.down,
        paidPayoff,
        entryPremiumProp,
        _baseTokenDecimals
);
```

The `IFeeManager::tradeSellFee` function states that the second-last parameter should be the entry premium. However in the above code snippet, entryPremiumProp is used instead.

<summary>Natspec for IFeeManager::tradeSellFee()</summary>

```javascript
/**
        Computes trade fee for selling options
        @param dvp The address of the DVP on which the trade is being performed
        @param expiry The expiry timestamp of current epoch of the DVP
        @param notional The notional of the traded option
        @param currPremium The current premium of the traded option (user payoff)
---->   @param entryPremium The premium paid for the option
        @param tokenDecimals # of decimals in the notation of the option base token
        @return fee The required fee
        @return minFee The required minimum fee paid for each trade which is transferred to the vault

     */
    function tradeSellFee(
        address dvp,
        uint256 expiry,
        uint256 notional,
        uint256 currPremium,
        uint256 entryPremium,
        uint8 tokenDecimals
    ) external view returns (uint256 fee, uint256 minFee);
```

<summary> Implementation of FeeManager::tradeSellFee() </summary>

```solidity
function tradeSellFee(
        address dvp,
        uint256 expiry,
        uint256 notional,
        uint256 currPremium,
        uint256 entryPremium,
        uint8 tokenDecimals
    ) external view returns (uint256 fee, uint256 minFee) {
        fee = _getFeeFromNotionalAndPremium(dvp, notional, currPremium, tokenDecimals, block.timestamp > expiry);

        if (currPremium > entryPremium) {
            uint256 pnl = currPremium - entryPremium;
            pnl = AmountsMath.wrapDecimals(pnl, tokenDecimals);
            uint256 successFee = pnl.wmul(_dvpsFeeParams[dvp].successFeeTier.get());
            successFee = AmountsMath.unwrapDecimals(successFee, tokenDecimals);

            fee += successFee;
        }

        minFee = _minFee(dvp, expiry);
        fee += minFee;
    }
```
</details>

In the above implementation, even if PnL is negative, the `currPremium > entryPremium` condition will still execute (since `entryPremiumProp` is passed in instead of `entryPremium`. Then the successFee will be calculated even though the trade was not succesful, causing even more fund loss for traders.

> Note: If somehow this is actually intended behaviour, and the code comment is supposed to be `entryPremiumProp`, then the tradeSellFee calculated within `DVP::payoff()` is incorrect since it uses the entry premium when calculating tradeFee rather than using entryPremiumProp.

## Impact

The successFee calculated within the `tradeSellFee` function will be inflated incorrectly due to PnL being inflated incorrectly. Because of this, the fees calculated are much higher than what is correct, so traders are much less incentivised to participate here due to the breaking of core protocol functionality.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `position.premium` rather than `entryPremiumProp` as the `entryPremium` parameter for the `FeeManager::tradeSellFee()` function.
```diff
(uint256 fee, uint256 vaultFee) = feeManager.tradeSellFee(
        address(this),
        expiry,
        amount.up + amount.down,
        paidPayoff,
-       entryPremiumProp,
+       position.premium,
        _baseTokenDecimals
);
```
